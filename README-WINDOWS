The document now provides a step by step procedure that takes the user
from a basic Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7 workstation to an OpenAFS
development environment.   Details are provided so that a 'beginning'
windows developer can build an OpenAFS installable package for Windows
2000/XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7.

NOTE 1:
As of the OpenAFS 1.3 release series, Windows platforms released
prior to Windows 2000 are no longer supported.	As of the OpenAFS 1.5
series, the Windows 9x components are being removed from the source tree.


****** Windows XP/2003/Vista/2008/Win7/2008-R2 Build Process ******

Building OpenAFS for Windows requires configuring a Windows
development system by installing compilation tools and header files.
OpenAFS Software development can be done on XP, 2003, Vista, Win7,
or 2008 system.  The target system, where OpenAFS will be installed,
can be one of:

 * Windows XP
 * Windows XP SP2
 * Windows 2003 
 * Windows 2003 SP1
 * Windows XP 64
 * Windows 2003 64
 * Windows 2003 R2 (32 or 64)
 * Windows Vista (32 or 64)
 * Windows 2008 (64)
 * Windows 7 (32 or 64)
 * Windows 2008 R2 (64)

The build process is controlled by a nmake file that generates the 
necessary binaries and binds them into an install package.

The following steps describe how to configure the development environment:

   A. Obtain a copy of the OpenAFS Source Tree
   B. Install Compiler and Development tools.
   C. Install SDK header files
   D. Configure NTBUILD.BAT
   E. Set program version Level
   F. Build the binaries
   I. Install Wix 2.0.5805
   J. Build Wix MSI Install Package
   K. Final Results
   L. Optional Items
   	
The Microsoft development tools require anywhere from 660 MB to 1.8GB
of storage depending on which compilers are selected.  The following 
versions are supported:

    Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005
      available via a MSDN subscription
      (used for OpenAFS.org distribution)
      Visual Studio 2005 SP1 is required to use Win7 as a development environment

    Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
      available via a MSDN subscription

Under some conditions, a conflict between Windows SDK headers and Windows DDK
headers causes difficulties using Visual Studio 2008 as a development
environment.  Visual Studio 2005 does not suffer from this issue.

One of the following Microsoft SDKs is required:

    Microsoft SDK for Windows 6.1
    Microsoft SDK for Windows 7.0

One of the following Microsoft DDK/WDK is required:

    Microsoft Windows Driver Kit 7600

NOTE: Not all combinations of Visual Studio, SDK, and DDK/WDK are 
known to work.  OpenAFS for Windows is packaged by Secure Endpoints Inc.
using the following configurations:

    32-bit Packages:
        Built on Windows 7
        Visual Studio 2008
        Windows [Platform] SDK 6.0a
        Windows DDK 7600
        Target: i386_w2k
        APPVER: 5.0

    64-bit Packages:
        Built on Windows 7
        Visual Studio 2008
        Windows [Platform] SDK 6.0a
        Windows DDK 7600
        Target: amd64_w2k
        APPVER: 5.02

The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop is required:

    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&displaylang=en

The Microsoft Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) Mitigation APIs 1.1 is required:

    http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=734

ActiveState Perl 5.10 is required for man-page generation

    http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/

Cygwin is required for Docbook to HTML and Docbook to HTMLHelp conversion

    http://cygwin.com/setup.exe

Doxygen is required for Developer Documentation generation

    http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/

The WiX installer requires about 18 MB of storage.  The following
version is supported:

    WiX 2.0.5805.0
      http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/44405

Newer versions of WiX (e.g., the 3.x series) are not supported.

The OpenAFS Source directory requires about 360 MB storage. The Source
directory size includes additional space for files that will be
generated during the build process.   A full build of Free and Checked
installers on 64-bit Windows will require up to 1GB of storage.


STEP A. Obtain a copy of the Open AFS Source Tree.

Transfer OpenAFS source tree onto your hardrive.  The source can be
downloaded from the OpenAFS web site:
	http://www.OpenAFS.org/release/snapindex.html.

For this example, download source for version 1.7.25 using the
following URL:
http://www.openafs.org/dl/openafs/1.7.25/openafs-1.7.25-src.tar
http://www.openafs.org/dl/openafs/1.7.25/openafs-1.7.25-doc.tar

HINT: DailySnapShots are pre-release source trees and much more
likely to have compilation errors. If this is your first attempt, do
your build based on a release version of the source, e.g. 1.7.25. Once
you have completed a build process successfully, you can experiment with
other source trees.

You will need an unzip utility that can expand compressed tar files.
For example "Pkzip for Windows" from Pkware will uncompress tar files.
(http://www.pkware.com/)

Expand the downloaded tar files into target directory (c:\OpenAFS), 
the unzip routine will expand the source into a subdirectory tree:
    c:\OpenAFS\OpenAFS-1.7.25\

Copy the file 'ntbuild.bat' from the 'src' subdirectory to the OpenAFS
base directory (aka %AFSROOT%):

  From a DOS command prompt window, enter the following copy commands:

    cd c:\OpenAFS\OpenAFS-1.7.25
    copy src\ntbuild.bat .

The OpenAFS base directory should look something like the following:

  c:\OpenAFS\OpenAFS-1.7.25\
    NTMakefile
    ntbuild.bat
    src
    doc

STEP B. Install compiler and development tools.

Install a copy of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005.  Visual Studio 2008
can be used to produce builds but the resulting binaries cannot be used
on Windows 2000.

(1) You can reduce the installation size by selecting "Custom" install
and remove all but the following Options:

	Microsoft Visual C++
	Data Access

(2) When asked, Select to Register Environment Variables.


STEP C. Install SDK header files.

Files from Microsoft's Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 SP1 are
required to complete a build on Windows 2000/XP/2003.   At a minimum the
following componets are known to be required: 

  * Core
  * Data Access
  * Installer
  * Windows Management Instrumentation
  * Web Workshop (IE)

It is advised that you install the entire SDK.  The SDK can be obtained
from:

  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6510

The header files that are required from a Microsoft SDK/WDK are:

   npapi.h    (Windows 2000,XP,2003 builds)
   netcfgx.h  (NSIS Loopback Adapter installer - Windows 2000,XP,2003 builds)
   netcfgn.h  (NSIS Loopback Adapter installer - Windows 2000,XP,2003 builds)
   normalization.h (AFS Cache Manager)

These files come from the following Microsoft DDKs/SDKs:

   npapi.h:
        Windows XP SP2 Platform SDK - include/

   netcfgn.h, netcfgx.h:
        Windows XP/2003 DDK - inc/wxp/

   normalization.h:
        Microsoft IDN Mitigation APIs 1.1 - include/

The Windows DDK can be obtained from:

  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=11800

STEP D. Configure NTBUILD.BAT.

The NTBUILD.BAT file copied to the OpenAFS base directory must be 
customized for use on your development system.  The provided NTBUILD.BAT
was developed for use with Visual Studio 2005 and the Windows Server 2008
Platform SDK.  It requires significant modification to construct a build
environment, due to differences between systems.

The following variables must be defined to match your configuration:

  AFSVER_CL: Set to 1200 if using MS Visual C++ 6.0
             Set to 1300 if using MS Visual Studio .NET
             Set to 1310 if using MS Visual Studio .NET 2003
             Set to 1400 if using MS Visual Studio .NET 2005
             Set to 1500 if using MS Visual Studio 2008
             Set to 1600 if using MS Visual Studio 2010
             Set to 1700 if using MS Visual Studio 2012

  MSVCDIR: Set to the short name version of the directory into which
           the visual C++ compiler was installed regardless of version

  MSVCDIR64: On AMD64 systems, set to the 64-bit visual C++ compiler

  MSSDKDIR: Set to the short name of the directory into which
            the Platform SDK was installed

  NTDDKDIR: Set to the short name of the INC\WNET DDK directory

  NTDDKDIR2: Set to the short name of the INC\CRT DDK directory

  MSIDNNLS: Set the the name of the Microsoft IDN Mitigation APIs 1.1
            directory

  AFSROOT: Set to the short name of the OpenAFS Base directory.  This
           cannot be set to a UNC path.

  SYS_NAME: One of "i386_w2k" or "amd64_w2k"

  APPVER:   5.0 for Windows 2000 and above; 5.1 for AMD64 systems

  _WIN32_IE: 0x500 for Windows 2000 and above; 0x502 for AMD64 systems

  CODESIGN_DESC: Product Name
  
  CODESIGN_TIMESTAMP: Time Stamp Service for Code Signing Certificate
   
  CODESIGN_URL: Support URL Displayed to End Users

  CODESIGN_CROSS_CERT: Path to Microsoft Cross Signing Certificate
                       (if you have one)

If no code signing tools are available, the resulting driver will not be
usable on 64-bit Vista and Win7 and newer systems, unless the system is
booted with the disable signing checks option from the F8 menu.


STEP E. Set version and installation options (optional)

Add a CellServDB file to install area. CellServDB contains the entries
for the various cell names.  You can download a general purpose one
from:
	http://grand.central.org/dl/cellservdb/CellServDB
then copy it to %AFSROOT%\src\WINNT\install\NSIS and name it afsdcell.ini

Edit file %AFSROOT%\src\config\NTMakefile.i386_w2k or NTMakefile.amd64_w2k
as appropriate:

    AFSPRODUCT_VER_MAJOR - Version Major Number
    AFSPRODUCT_VER_MINOR - Version Minor Number
    AFSPRODUCT_VER_PATCH - Version Patch Number
    AFSPRODUCT_VER_BUILD - Version Build Number
    CELLSERVDB_INSTALL   - The default file name for the CellServDB
                     	   included in the install Package.
    CELLNAME_DEFAULT     - The default home cell name.
    CELLSERVDB_WEB       - The default web address to obtain CellServDB

For example: in the file %AFSROOT%\src\config\NTMakefile.i386_w2k you would
see the following:

   AFSPRODUCT_VER_MAJOR=1
   AFSPRODUCT_VER_MINOR=7
   AFSPRODUCT_VER_PATCH=2500
   AFSPRODUCT_VER_BUILD=0
   CELLNAME_DEFAULT=openafs.org
   CELLSERVDB_INSTALL=CellServDB.GrandCentral
   CELLSERVDB_WEB=http://grand.central.org/dl/cellservdb/CellServDB

During the OpenAFS installation process the user will be presented
with two choices for the CellServDB: Local copy (CELLSERVDB_INSTALL) and
one that can be downloaded from the web (CELLSERVDB_WEB).

IMPORTANT: When building your own binaries, you must set the AFSPRODUCT_VER_BUILD
value to a number greater than 1023.  All values 0 to 1023 are reserved for use
by official OpenAFS.org releases.  A failure to do so will result in Windows 
Crash Reports for your binaries being delivered to OpenAFS.org for analysis.


STEP F. Begin the build

(1) Open a Command Prompt window (cmd.exe)

    Enable delayed variable expansion with "cmd /v"

(2) Change to the %AFSROOT% directory

(3) Configure the environment variables:

    For a release build (SMB version):

    (a) Execute the VCVARS32.BAT or VSVARS32.BAT file which part of the
        Visual Studio environment you installed.

    (b) Execute the SETENV.CMD file from the Windows SDK with the parameters
        "/2000 /RETAIL"

    (c) Execute the NTBUILD.BAT file with the parameter "free"

    For a debug build (SMB version):

    (a) Execute the VCVARS32.BAT or VSVARS32.BAT file which part of the
        Visual Studio environment you installed.

    (b) Execute the SETENV.CMD file from the Windows SDK with the parameters
        "/2000 /DEBUG"

    (c) Execute the NTBUILD.BAT file with the parameter "checked"

(4) Build the complete Windows 2000/XP/2003 development environment.

      nmake /f NTMakefile install

While the build is running you will see many compile warnings. This
behavior is normal; the build process is successful as long as the build
process doesn't terminate with an error ("nmake.exe return code 0x2")
and it displays 'Build Finished Successfully'.  Note that although the 
the build target is "install", it does not install OpenAFS.

(5) Before rebuilding you must clean the work area:

    nmake /f NTMakefile clean


STEP G. NSIS is no longer used, it does not support 64-bit systems

STEP I.  Install Wix MSI Installer

Download the WiX 2.0.5805.0 binaries from

    http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/44405

STEP J.  Build Wix MSI install package

From the %AFSROOT% directory execute:

    nmake /f NTMakefile wix

Make sure the binaries installed to \src\wix\release\ship are
available in the PATH environment variable


STEP K. Final Results

The build process generates its binaries in %AFSROOT%\DEST. The subdirectory
would look like the following:

%AFSROOT%\DEST\{checked,free}\
	bin
	etc
	include
	lib
	root.client
	root.server
	WinInstall

    Bin - contains build utilities.
    root.client - contains Open AFS binaries
    root.server - contain Open AFS Server binaries
    WinInstall\OpenAFSforWindows.exe - is the NSIS install package
    WinInstall\openafs-en_US.msi - is the WiX MSI install package


STEP L. Optional Items

The build process has an error table that is compiled for many OpenAFS
applications.  This table is generated by Unix based tools.  It is not
normally necessary to modify this table so pre-generated source files
are included in the OpenAFS source.  If you need to make modifications
in these areas the Unix base tools that run on Windows can be found on
the web. For example:

	http://cygwin.com/

Below is a short explanation how to update the error table.

(1) Install flex and bison from a Unix based tool provider.

(2) Make changes to the source files.

There are two files in the source tree that are processed with lex
and yacc on UNIX systems, src/comerr/et_lex.lex.l and
src/comerr/error_table.y, that when processed produce the files
et_lex.lex_nt.c, error_table_nt.c, and error_table_nt.h.

Since NT does not include lex and yacc or any equivalent tools, we
have provided the output files that lex and yacc produce (using Win32
ports of flex and bison). This will allow builds to work for anyone
who does not need to change the .l and .y files.

If you do need to change et_lex.lex.l, then you will need to install
Win32 port of flex on your system. Put flex.exe in a directory on the
path and rebuild.

If you do need to change error_table.y, then you will need to install
a Win32 port of bison on your system. Put bison.exe in a directory on
the path, configure bison as explained in step 5, and rebuild.

You can also attempt to use other replacements for lex and yacc. This
will require modifying the LEX and YACC settings in
/config/NTMakefile.i386_nt40. If the replacements require different
command line options than flex and bison, then you may also need to
change src/comerr/NTMakefile.

(3) Generate new OpenAFS binaries
