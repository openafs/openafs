The document now provides a step by step procedure that takes the user 
from a basic Windows 2000/XP/2003 workstation to an OpenAFS development 
environment.   Details are provided so that a 'beginning' windows 
developer can build an OpenAFS installable package for Windows 2000/XP/2003.

NOTE 1:
As of the OpenAFS 1.3 release series, Windows platforms released
prior to Windows 2000 are no longer supported.	As of the OpenAFS 1.5
series, the Windows 9x components are being removed from the source tree.

NOTE 2:
In this release, in addition to the production quality CIFS-AFS 
gateway based client service there also exists an experimental
implementation of an Installable File System (IFS).  To build the IFS 
version, follow the directions below, but note that only the NSIS 
installer script has been updated to support it.  Also, the IFS kernel 
module must be built separately, using the IFS/DDK build environment.
The IFS implementation does not contain a Network Provider interface
to register an AFS service name.

***********   Windows 2000/XP/2003 Build Process ****************

Building OpenAFS for Windows requires configuring a Windows
development system by installing compilation tools and header files.
Open AFS Software development can be done on Windows 2000, XP, 2003, 
or Vista.  The target system, where OpenAFS will be installed, can be 
one of:

 * Windows 2000
 * Windows XP
 * Windows XP SP2
 * Windows 2003 
 * Windows 2003 SP1
 * Windows XP 64
 * Windows 2003 64
 * Windows 2003 R2 (32 or 64)
 * Windows Vista (32 or 64)

The build process is controlled by a nmake file that generates the 
necessary binaries and binds them into an install package.

The following steps describe how to configure Windows 2000/XP:

   A. Obtain a copy of the OpenAFS Source Tree
   B. Install Compiler and Development tools.
   C. Install SDK header files
   D. Configure NTBUILD.BAT
   E. Set program version Level
   F. Build the binaries
   G. Install NSIS 2.30
   H. Build NSIS Install Package
   I. Install Wix 2.0.4310
   J. Build Wix MSI Install Package
   K. Final Results
   L. Optional Items
   	
The Microsoft development tools require anywhere from 660 MB to 1.8GB
of storage depending on which compilers are selected.  The following 
versions are supported:

    Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 
      available via a MSDN subscription

    Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003
      available via a MSDN subscription

    Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 (required for AMD64 builds)
      available via a MSDN subscription
      (recommended - required for 64-bit builds)

The following Microsoft SDK is required:

    Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows XP SP2 or Server 2003 SP1 or Vista
      http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/downlevel.htm [IE required]
      http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/XPSP2FULLInstall.htm

The following Microsoft DDK is required:

    Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP1 DDK
      available via a MSDN subscription or via free CD
      http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/ddk/orderddkcd.mspx

The Microsoft HTML Help Workshop is required:

    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=00535334-c8a6-452f-9aa0-d597d16580cc&displaylang=en

The NSIS installer requires about 14 MB of storage. The following 
version is supported:

    Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System 2.30
      http://nsis.sourceforge.net/home/

The WiX installer requires about 18 MB of storage.  The following 
version is supported:

    Wix 2.0.4310.0
      http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wix/sources-2.0.4310.0.zip

The InstallShield scripts (although not supported) require version 5.5
of InstallShiled. Version 6.0 or higher of InstallShield are not 
compatible.

The OpenAFS Source directory requires about 360 MB storage. The Source
directory size includes additional space for files that will be
generated during the build process.


STEP A. Obtain a copy of the Open AFS Source Tree.

Transfer OpenAFS source tree onto your hardrive.  The source can be
downloaded from the OpenAFS web site:
	http://www.OpenAFS.org/release/snapindex.html.

For this example, download source for version 1.3.74 using the
following URL:
http://www.openafs.org/dl/openafs/1.3.74/openafs-1.3.74-src.tar

HINT: DailySnapShots are pre-release source trees and much more
likely to have compilation errors. If this is your first attempt, do
your build based on a release version of the source, e.g. 1.3.74. Once
you have completed a build process successfully, you can experiment with
other source trees.

You will need an unzip utility that can expand compressed tar files.
For example "Pkzip for Windows" from Pkware will uncompress tar files.
(http://www.pkware.com/)

Expand the downloaded tar file (openafs-1.3.74-src.tar) into target
directory (c:\OpenAFS), the unzip routine will expand the source into a
subdirectory tree:
    c:\OpenAFS\OpenAFS-1.3.74\src

Copy the files 'NTMakefile' and 'ntbuild.bat' from 'src' to the OpenAFS 
base directory (aka %AFSROOT%):

  From a DOS command prompt window, enter the following copy commands:

    cd c:\OpenAFS\OpenAFS-1.3.74
    copy src\NTMakefile .
    copy src\ntbuild.bat .


The OpenAFS base directory should look something like the following:

  c:\OpenAFS\OpenAFS-1.3.74\
    NTMakefile
    ntbuild.bat
    src
	  

STEP B. Install compiler and development tools.

Install a copy of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET, Visual Studio .NET 2003, 
or Visual Studio .NET 2005.  The "Typical" install setting is sufficient.

(1) You can reduce the installation size by selecting "Custom" install
and remove all but the following Options:

	Microsoft Visual C++
	Data Access

(2) When asked, Select to Register Environment Variables.


STEP C. Install SDK header files.

Files from Microsoft's Platform SDK for Windows XP SP2 or Server 2003 are
required to complete a build on Windows 2000/XP/2003.   You can install 
the "Core, Data Access and Installer SDKs" from

  http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/

by using Internet Explorer 5.x or higher.  (Active X controls are required)
If you do not which to use IE a complete SDK package is available from

  http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/XPSP2FULLInstall.htm

The header files that are required from a Microsoft SDK/DDK are:

   npapi.h    (Windows 2000,XP,2003 builds)
   netcfgx.h  (NSIS Loopback Adapter installer - Windows 2000,XP,2003 builds)
   netcfgn.h  (NSIS Loopback Adapter installer - Windows 2000,XP,2003 builds)

These files come from the following Microsoft DDKs/SDKs:

   npapi.h:
        Windows XP SP2 Platform SDK - include/

   netcfgn.h, netcfgx.h:
        Windows XP/2003 DDK - inc/wxp/

If you are interested in experimenting with the IFS you must purchase from
Microsoft a copy of the Windows 2003 SP1 IFS Kit.

  http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/ifskit/default.mspx


STEP D. Configure NTBUILD.BAT.

The NTBUILD.BAT file copied to the OpenAFS base directory must be 
customized for use on your development system.  The following variables
must be defined to match your configuration:

  AFSVER_CL: Set to 1200 if using MS Visual C++ 6.0
             Set to 1300 if using MS Visual Studio .NET
             Set to 1310 if using MS Visual Studio .NET 2003
             Set to 1400 if using MS Visual Studio .NET 2005

  MSVCDIR: Set to the short name version of the directory into which
           the visual C++ compiler was installed regardless of version

  MSVCDIR64: On AMD64 systems, set to the 64-bit visual C++ compiler

  MSSDKDIR: Set to the short name of the directory into which
            the Platform SDK was installed

  NTDDKDIR: Set to the short name of the INC\WNET DDK directory

  NTDDKDIR2: Set to the short name of the INC\CRT DDK directory

  AFSROOT: Set to the short name of the OpenAFS Base directory.  This
           cannot be set to a UNC path.

  SYS_NAME: One of "i386_w2k" or "amd64_w2k"

  APPVER:   0x500 for Windows 2000 and above; 0x502 for AMD64 systems

  _WIN32_IE: Must match APPVER

  MSVCVer:  Set to 8.0 if using Visual Studio 8


STEP E. Set version and installation options (optional)

Add a CellServDB file to install area. CellServDB contains the entries
for the various cell names.  You can download a general purpose one
from:
	http://grand.central.org/dl/cellservdb/CellServDB
then copy it to %AFSROOT%\src\WINNT\install\NSIS and name it afsdcell.ini

Edit file %AFSROOT%\src\config\NTMakefile.i386_w2k
    AFSPRODUCT_VER_MAJOR - Version Major Number
    AFSPRODUCT_VER_MINOR - Version Minor Number
    AFSPRODUCT_VER_PATCH - Version Patch Number
    AFSPRODUCT_VER_BUILD - Version Build Number
    CELLSERVDB_INSTALL   - The default file name for the CellServDB
                     	   included in the install Package.
    CELLNAME_DEFAULT     - The default home cell name.
    CELLSERVDB_WEB       - The default web address to obtain CellServDB

For example: in the file %AFSROOT%\src\config\NTMakefile.i386_nt40 you would
see the following:

   AFSPRODUCT_VER_MAJOR=1
   AFSPRODUCT_VER_MINOR=3
   AFSPRODUCT_VER_PATCH=7400
   AFSPRODUCT_VER_BUILD=0
   CELLNAME_DEFAULT=openafs.org
   CELLSERVDB_INSTALL=CellServDB.GrandCentral
   CELLSERVDB_WEB=http://grand.central.org/dl/cellservdb/CellServDB

During the Open AFS installation process the user will be presented
with two choices for the CellServDB: Local copy (CELLSERVDB_INSTALL) and
one that can be downloaded from the web (CELLSERVDB_WEB).

STEP F. Begin the build

(1) From Windows 2000/XP/2003 open up a DOS prompt window.

(2) Change to the %AFSROOT% directory

(3) Configure the environment variables:

    For a release build (SMB version):

    (a) Execute the VCVARS32.BAT or VSVARS32.BAT file which part of the
        Visual Studio environment you installed.

    (b) Execute the SETENV.BAT file with the parameters "/2000 /RETAIL"

    (c) Execute the NTBUILD.BAT file with the parameter "free"

    For a release build (IFS version):

    (a) Execute the VCVARS32.BAT or VSVARS32.BAT file which part of the
        Visual Studio environment you installed.

    (b) Execute the SETENV.BAT file with the parameters "/2000 /RETAIL"

    (c) Execute the NTBUILD.BAT file with the parameter "free ifs"

    For a debug build (SMB version):

    (a) Execute the VCVARS32.BAT or VSVARS32.BAT file which part of the
        Visual Studio environment you installed.

    (b) Execute the SETENV.BAT file with the parameters "/2000 /DEBUG"

    (c) Execute the NTBUILD.BAT file with the parameter "checked"

    For a debug build (IFS version):

    (a) Execute the VCVARS32.BAT or VSVARS32.BAT file which part of the
        Visual Studio environment you installed.

    (b) Execute the SETENV.BAT file with the parameters "/2000 /DEBUG"

    (c) Execute the NTBUILD.BAT file with the parameter "checked ifs"

(4) Clean the work area:

    nmake /f NTMakefile clean

(5) Build the complete Windows 2000/XP/2003 development environment.

    nmake /f NTMakefile install

While the build is running you will see many compile warnings. This
behavior is normal; the build process is successful as long as the build
process doesn't terminate with an error ("nmake.exe return code 0x2")
and it displays 'Build Finished Successfully'.

(6) [IFS only] Open a DDK/IFS Build Environment command window, change 
    to the src\WINNT\afsrdr directory, and execute the "build" command.


STEP G. Install NSIS 2.30 (optional).

Download the Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System (NSIS) 2.30 from

    http://nsis.sourceforge.net/home/

Run the nsis-2.30.exe installer and install to "C:\Program Files\NSIS".
Then download the large strings build zip file and replace the installed 
files with the versions from the zip file.  These versions increase 
the maximum string length from 1024 characters to 8192 characters.  
This is necessary for installation on systems with long PATH environment 
strings.

Note: The NSIS installer can only be used to produce 32-bit installers.

STEP H.  Build OpenAFS NSIS install package

From the %AFSROOT% directory execute:

    nmake /f NTMakefile NSIS


STEP I.  Install Wix MSI Installer

Download the Wix 2.0.2217.0 installer from 

    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wix/sources-2.0.2217.0.zip

Apply the following patches to the source tree and execute 

    make ship

from the \src\wix directory.

STEP J.  Build Wix MSI install package

From the %AFSROOT% directory execute:

    nmake /f NTMakefile wix

Make sure the binaries installed to \src\wix\release\ship are
available in the PATH environment variable


STEP K. Final Results

The build process generates its binaries in %AFSROOT%\DEST. The subdirectory
would look like the following:

%AFSROOT%\DEST\{checked,free}\
	bin
	etc
	include
	lib
	root.client
	root.server
	WinInstall

    Bin - contains build utilities.
    root.client - contains Open AFS binaries
    root.server - contain Open AFS Server binaries
    WinInstall\OpenAFSforWindows.exe - is the NSIS install package
    WinInstall\openafs-en_US.msi - is the WiX MSI install package


STEP L. Optional Items

The build process has an error table that is compiled for many OpenAFS
applications.  This table is generated by Unix based tools.  It is not
normally necessary to modify this table so pre-generated source files
are included in the OpenAFS source.  If you need to make modifications
in these areas the Unix base tools that run on Windows can be found on
the web. For example:

	http://cygwin.com/

Below is a short explanation how to update the error table.

(1) Install flex and bison from a Unix based tool provider.

(2) Make changes to the source files.

There are two files in the source tree that are processed with lex
and yacc on UNIX systems, src/comerr/et_lex.lex.l and
src/comerr/error_table.y, that when processed produce the files
et_lex.lex_nt.c, error_table_nt.c, and error_table_nt.h.

Since NT does not include lex and yacc or any equivalent tools, we
have provided the output files that lex and yacc produce (using Win32
ports of flex and bison). This will allow builds to work for anyone
who does not need to change the .l and .y files.

If you do need to change et_lex.lex.l, then you will need to install
Win32 port of flex on your system. Put flex.exe in a directory on the
path and rebuild.

If you do need to change error_table.y, then you will need to install
a Win32 port of bison on your system. Put bison.exe in a directory on
the path, configure bison as explained in step 5, and rebuild.

You can also attempt to use other replacements for lex and yacc. This
will require modifying the LEX and YACC settings in
/config/NTMakefile.i386_nt40. If the replacements require different
command line options than flex and bison, then you may also need to
change src/comerr/NTMakefile.

(3) Generate new OpenAFS binaries
