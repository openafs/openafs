Since 1.4.1 rc9:  1.4.1 rc10 released (10 March 2006)

 * Fix the rx-lwp implementation to randomly generate rx call
   identifiers which are supposed to be unique at a given point
   in time.  This affects some of the command line tools used
   for debugging but not the AFS Client Service itself which
   uses the rx-pthreads implementation.

 * xstats_fs_test.exe and xstats_cm_test.exe are now built for
   Windows although they are not distributed

 * don't generate an exception when logging unexpected SMB packets

 * the data structures used by cm_IoctlGetVolumeStatus and 
   cm_IoctlSetVolumeStatus are not compatible with the CIFS
   Get/Set File Information calls so don't bother executing them.

Since 1.4.1 rc8:

 * Nothing

Since 1.4.1 rc7: 

 * Windows will return WSAECONNRESET to the next receive packet
   operation on a socket if an ICMP packet is received in response
   to a packet that was sent and could not be delivered because
   the port was unreachable.  We have to treat this as 
   WSAEWOULDBLOCK so that we can retry the select() check and
   not mark the connection as bad.

Since 1.4.1 rc6: 1.4.1 rc7 released (14 Feb 2006)

 * The client manager maintains a least recently used list of
   all the ACLs.  If an ACL is already the most recently used
   do not bother to remove it from the list and place it on the
   front.

 * As part of the process of adding a new server, set the 
   server is down flag and then perform a ping.  If the server
   is up, the flag will be reset.  If the server is down, the
   client will not timeout unnecessarily while attempting to
   perform real work.

 * If a Mountpoint String is the empty string, return PATH NOT 
   FOUND.

 * Modify behavior of the Network Provider to avoid querying the
   profile location if integrated logon is known to be disabled.

 * Correct behavior of 'LogoffPreserveTokens'.  When set, tokens
   will always be preserved regardless of whether or not integrated
   logon was used to obtain tokens.  When unset, tokens will be 
   destroyed regardless of whether integrated logon was used to 
   obtain the tokens unless the profile is stored in AFS.

 * Disable LogoffTransferToken functionality.  The SMB V3 Logoff
   message is being delivered even when the user is not logging
   off of the computer.  

 * Fix a deadlock condition introduced in rc6.

 * Cell names are case-insensitive.  Since the founding of OpenAFS
   there has been a bug that treated "cell", "Cell", and "CELL" as
   different cells.  This would result in what appeared to be 
   random disappearance of user tokens or a failure to authenticate
   even when tokens were listed by the "tokens" command.

Since 1.4.1 rc5: 1.4.1 rc6 released (2 Feb 2006)

 * Additional auditing of the smb code revealed that smb ioctl
   operations were failing to free smb_fid_t objects

 * The File Identifiers assigned to smb_fid_t objects could be
   given the value 65535 which is 0xFFFF which is also the 
   INVALID_HANDLE value.  Both 0 and 65535 are now treated as
   reserved values.

 * Audited all assignments to fields and ensured that they are
   protected by obtaining the relevant mutex object.

 * Re-wrote the VNOVNODE handling to avoid a potential deadlock
   if both the current cm_scache_t object and its parent are
   both returning VNOVNODE.

 * Removed all the logic associated with the 'dead_vcp' variable
   which must have been added for debugging because its used 
   was never thread safe and it truly served no purpose.

Since 1.4.1 rc4: 1.4.1 rc5 released (25 Jan 2006)
				    
 * Re-enabled LogoffTokenTransfer and LogoffTokenTransferTimeout
   registry settings.  Default is ON and 120 seconds.  If set to
   OFF, tokens will not be destroyed.

 * Fixed a number of race conditions and reference count 
   problems associated with global queues.

 * Added a method to detect abandonded smb virtual circuits
   so their associated file handles, locks, user tokens,
   and smb session resources can be released.

 * Added a mechanism to allow user tokens to be preserved 
   during integrated login and be freed after logoff.

 * Check access permissions to the file before the file is 
   truncated.

 * More improvements to the handling of SMB Virtual Circuits
   when SMB sessions are closed.

 * Correct a race condition introduced in rc4 that could result
   in a crash of afsd_service.exe.

Since 1.4.1 rc3: 1.4.1 rc4 released (11 Jan 2006)

 * Properly handle pre-mature SMB session closures.
   File handles, tree connections, and user sessions are now
   freed when the virtual circuit is closed.

 * smb_username_t and smb_user_t objects are now properly reference
   counted and freed as appropriate.

 * disable the use of AFS file locks.  Byte range locking is still
   implemented but all locks are managed locally.  This prevents
   multiple processes from editing the same file on the same 
   machine but it does not prevent multiple processes on separate 
   machines from modifying the file.

Since 1.4.1 rc2: 1.4.1 RC3 released (4 Jan 2006)

 * A fix to "fs setserverprefs -vlserver".  Multiple calls with
   the same server parameter would result in a panic condition
   if the server had not already been contacted by the AFS 
   client service.

 * Better warnings are written to the afsd.log file when 
   the Windows RPC Protocols are not properly configured as
   is often the case on Windows 2000.

 * fix the procmgmt library to restore C RTL signal handlers when 
   it is being detached from the process prior to process termination.

Since 1.4.1 rc1: 1.4.1 RC2 released (30 Nov 2005)

 * close a lock leak in the rx library that could be triggered while
   processing aborts

 * prevent removal of drive mappings in response to afscreds.exe -M

 * add logic to process VNOVNODE in cm_Analyze.  Force re-evaluation of symlink
   strings and flush the stat cache entry.

 * prevent server objects from being freed if user preferences are set.

 * Update WIX support to 2.0.2419.0

 * Release all locks on the server at service shutdown.

 * A down server should be marked up as long as it responds to the client.
   It doesn't matter if the server returned an error as long as the error
   is something other than VRESTARTING.	 If there is such an error, all
   connections on that server should be marked for replacement.

 * Change the check "up" servers period from once per hour to once every
   ten minutes.  This matches the behavior of the Unix cache manager.

Post 1.4.0 revisions: 1.4.1 RC1 released (21 Oct 2005)
 * Byte Range Locking support has been added.  Architectural documentation
   is located within src/WINNT/afsd/cm_vnodeops.c.   Best efforts are 
   made to enforce Windows mandatory locking model using locally managed
   byte range locks with full file locks obtained from the file server.
   Read-only volumes provide the user with an implied locking privilege.
   Read-write volumes require that a user be granted the locking privilege
   in order for a lock to be obtained.   As most Windows applications use
   Shared file access modes, they require the ability to obtain locks in
   order to access files.

 * Implement error translation functions to convert Universal Error Codes
   output by modern servers to local errno and winsock error values.
   This fixes the error message problems using pioctl() calls from fs.exe 
   and the AFS Shell Extension.

Since 1.4.0 rc8: 1.4.0 final tagged (20 Oct 2005); released (31 Oct 2005)
 * Allow the AFS Client Service to set the firewall configuration by
   retrying until after Windows determines the boot period is over.

 * Do not attempt to configure the firewall on Windows 2000, XP pre-SP2,
   or 2003 pre-SP1

 * Detect IP address changes from within the AFS Client Service for the
   purpose of checking down servers sooner

 * If the file server or vldb server report RXKADUNKNOWNKEY, return
   SEC_E_NO_KERB_KEY to Windows.   This provides an indication to the
   user that there is a Kerberos key problem.  Previously the user would
   receive no feedback when there was something wrong.

 * Fix the large integer library support to properly handle values greater
   than 32-bits

Since 1.4.0 rc7: 1.4.0 rc8 released (15 Oct 2005)
 * Updated CellServDB

 * Fixed file name pattern matching.  Question marks can match nothing
   if found at the end of a component.

Since 1.4.0 rc6: 1.4.0 rc7 released (8 Oct 2005)
 * Kerberos 5 ticket lifetimes should adhere to KFW Leash lifetimes

 * The MSI installer now has a new Product ID for each build.  This
   is to allow for automated upgrades.   The Upgrade ID is remaining
   constant.

 * Volumes that were cached and then subsequently were salvaged,
   moved or otherwise taken temporarily offline (as opposed to being
   busy) would become unreachable.  A distinction is now made between
   a volume being offline and a server being down.

Since 1.4.0 rc5: 1.4.0 rc6 released (2 Oct 2005)

 * Fixed several AFS Shell Extension issues:
   - Checking Server Status would only work if a specific cell was
     specified.
   - If servers were down, the Server Down dialog would write to 
     invalid memory and cause explorer.exe to crash
   - Default Push Buttons were not specified for many dialogs
   - The extension would be unloaded by the Explorer Shell and
     never be reloaded under some circumstances. 

 * Fixed the AFS System Tray menu to disappear if another Window
   was selected before a menu item was selected

 * Added volume owner and group information to "fs examine" output

 * Added fs and registry support for enabling/disabling/clearing 
   rx statistics gathering.

Since 1.4.0 rc4: 1.4.0 rc5 released (25 Sep 2005)

 * New Product Code GUIDs issues for 1.4 and 1.5 branches.  Separate
   GUIDs for each platform.

 * Documentation directory structure and default installation rules
   for MSI 

 * New OpenAFS for Windows HTML Release Notes installed
   as part of the documentation set.

 * Add thread id to rx debugging messages

 * When all servers are offline, return a bad network path error
   immediately.  This is necessary to allow Explorer to do the 
   right thing and not hang.   The background daemon thread will
   check the down servers every 30 seconds to see if they are
   back up.  

Since 1.4.0 rc3: 1.4.0 rc4 released (14 Sep 2005)

 * The AFSCache file has been modified to store both the
   serial number of the volume on which the file resides
   and the SID of the local machine.   If either change,
   a new UUID is generated.

 * add "fs flushall" command that forces all data buffers
   to be flushed.

Since 1.4.0 rc2: 1.4.0 rc3 released (4 Sep 2005)

 * add support for '/' instead of '\' in pioctl() calls

 * Apply AFS Client Admins group protect to AFS Shell Extension

 * Add support for \\afs\<name> to most AFS Shell Extension 
   commands except the symlink methods. 

 * when installing the Microsoft Loopback Adapter, enable
   MS Client for Networks and prevent an install failure 
   by not calling CoInitialize twice in the same thread.

 * reload cell vldb values from the CellServDB every two
   hours in case it changes

 * When updating cell information from DNS, be sure to set 
   a new timeout.

 * Add support to allow use of \\AFS\<foo> where <foo> is 
   either a mount point or symlink.   As <foo> is normally 
   treated as a share name, we transform it into \\AFS\all\<foo> 
   for processing.

 * Init 'code' to prevent false errors when integrated logon 
   is disabled and the service is not running

Since 1.4.0 rc1: 1.4.0 rc2 released (28 Aug 2005)

 * Removed trace log messages that were hampering performance.

 * Fixed a deadlock that was being triggered by editing Word 
   documents stored within AFS with WinWord 2003.

 * Bit 3 of the TraceOption registry value is now used to set the
   default for "fs trace" in the non-Debug builds.  The new default
   is off for release builds and on for debug builds.

 * Bit 2 of the TraceOption registry value can be used to turn on
   real-time output of debug log entries to the Windows Debug
   Output monitor interface.  This data can be viewed with tools
   such as Sysinternal's DbgView.

Since 1.3.87: 1.4.0 rc1 released (17 Aug 2005)
 * When the cache manager reports ALLBUSY or ALLOFFLINE for
   a resource we should not be returning status codes such
   as Network Busy or Remote Host Down because these errors
   will imply that the AFS Client Service is Busy or Down
   and that is simply not the case.   Instead we will return
   Bad Network Path as the path is temporarily not available.

   Instead of returning Sharing Paused when there is a
   timeout error, return Timeout.  Once again, the AFS Client
   Service is not paused.

 * afscreds.exe would display an Obtain Creds dialog when
   the expired credentials reminder was triggered even 
   if there was no network path to the KDC.  This is prevented
   by adding KDC probe logic to the reminder thread.  

 * afscreds.exe would display expired tokens no differently
   than unexpired ones.  This would make it difficult for the
   user to distiguish when the tokens were expired.  For the 
   English build added a new resource string "(expired) that
   is displayed instead of the expiration time. 

Since 1.3.86:
 * "fs wscell" when executed in freelance mode will return the
   name of the cell configured in the registry.  The root.afs
   volume is not loaded from this cell, but it is used for the
   default for aklog and integrated login.

 * "fs mkmount, fs rmmount, symlink make, symlink remove" will
   no longer work on \\AFS\all when freelance is being used 
   unless the user is a member of the "AFS Client Admins" Windows
   Security group.

 * some more checks performed during persistent cache validation.

Since 1.3.85:
 * Optimize calls to cm_CheckServer from cm_Analyze.  Only check
   down servers for the current cell not all cells.

 * If the scache LRU list becomes corrupted, the AFS Client Service
   might enter an infinite loop at startup.   Detect the corruption
   and discard the cache contents in this case.

 * Fixed the Explorer Shell's remove mountpoint functionality.

 * Fixed a deadlock caused by the holder of cm_aclLock attempting to 
   obtain a mutex lock on a cm_scache_t object whose lock is held by
   a thread attempting to obtain the cm_aclLock.

Since 1.3.84:
 * Really fixed DNS AFSDB queries to ensure that "csail" cannot be
   misinterpretted as "csail.mit.edu" when the resolver 
   is configured to append ".mit.edu" to failed DNS queries.

 * Added a new registry key, "LogoffPreserveTokens" (see registry.txt),
   that can be used to force the preservation of user tokens upon logout.

 * Update the NSIS install scripts to use NSIS 2.07.   This release adds 
   recommended installation categories: AFS Client, AFS Administrator,
   AFS Server, AFS Development Kit.  Each category includes a different 
   default subset of the OpenAFS components.

   The OpenAFS logo is now associated with the NSIS uninstall entry
   in the Add/Remove Programs control panel.

 * The user name associated with AFS tokens when obtained with
   integrated login, the afs systray tool, or aklog will always
   include the full Kerberos 5 user principal name regardless of 
   whether or not the cell is local to the realm.

 * Modify integrated login so that it does not enter an infinite
   loop if the service is not set to auto start.

 * Added asetkey.exe used to set a Kerberos 5 key for use by the
   AFS server daemons

 * Added uninstall.exe to Wix installation

 * More modifications to algorithms used to wake sleeping threads.

Since 1.3.83:

 * Changes to the algorithms used to wake threads when they are
   put to sleep because of conflicts over buffer operations.

Since 1.3.82:
 * The OpenAFS integrated logon obtains Kerberos 5 tickets as part of 
   the process of producing AFS tokens.  The tokens are stored within
   the AFS Client Service but the Kerberos 5 tickets have been discarded.
   New functionality has been added to temporarily copy the tickets to
   a file ccache during the short window between the NPLogonNotify and
   WinLogon Logon Event.  The Logon Event handler starts a process as
   user, afscpcc.exe, that copies the tickets into the default ccache.
   The file ccache is then destroyed by the event handler.

 * During synchronization operations on stat cache entries, if threads
   are forced to sleep it was possible that the threads would not be
   woken under heavy load.

 * Enforce the delete on close flag specified by the NTCreateX()
   operation.

 * A race condition in the rx library was fixed that resulted in 
   a deadlock in rx_NewCall when the RX_CONN_MAKECALL_WAITING flag
   was cleared when threads were still waiting to use the 
   connection.   Also, fixed a potential case in which the 
   connection could be destroyed while threads were waiting to use it.

 * The DNLC freelist has been seen to become corrupted with still 
   active entries being stored on the freelist.  Changes were made
   to perform a better job of cleaning entries before placing them
   onto the freelist; marking them with the correct magic value when
   purging the list; and allowing the list to be purged on startup
   if the cache validation fails.

 * Windows Crash Reporting does not get triggered for afsd_service.exe
   because it provides its own top level exception handler.  This patch 
   places an explicit call to ReportCrash() on platforms which support 
   it.  (XP and above.)

   If you configure Crash Reporting via AD Policy to capture crash
   reports within the domain, then you will receive this output.

 * Generate MiniDumps independent of the Windows Crash Reporting.
 
   (a) If an exception occurs,a minidump will be generated at the path
       %TEMP%\afsd.dmp. The type of minidump defaults to Normal but 
       can be set to any other type via use of the
       registry.      

       [HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client]  MiniDumpType (DWORD)

   (b) MiniDumps can be generated at any time using the "fs minidump"
       command.   This allows you to generate a minidump without 
       stopping the process or even requiring the use of a debugger
       on the system.

  * an RX connection which reports bad ticket now treats it the same way
    the expired ticket is treated.   The ticket is removed from the 
    connection and a new anonymous connection is established.

  * fs memdump now requires that the caller be in the AFS Client Admins
    group

  * additional debugging information is provided in cm_Analyze when the
    error code is ignored.

  * Fix a regression introduced into the pioctl() client code which
    will cause a crash in winlogon.exe, explorer.exe and fs.exe if
    MIT KFW is not installed. (1.3.82a)

  * Remove AFS Gateway option from OpenAFS Control Panel (1.3.82a)

Since 1.3.81:
  * Fix a race condition in cm_EndCallbackGrantingCall() that 
    could leave 'nrevp' pointing to freed memory.  In the process,
    optimize the processing to ensure that the applications monitoring
    the status of the stat cache entry are only notified at most 
    once.

  * Conditionalize access to the Explorer Shell AFS->Mount Point
    ->Remove menu item.  Disable the item if the selected item(s)
    are not mount points.

  * Activate AFS RPC (RX) Free Packet Queues stored in Thread
    Local Storage.  This eliminates thread contention on the
    global RX free packet queue.  This should improve performance
    on multi-CPU systems.

  * Fix the IP address filtering code to properly load/unload
    the IPHelper DLL so that Windows XP/2003 and beyond systems
    do not have to manually probe the registry.

  * CleanupACLEnt() was not being called consistently with 
    the cm_scache_t object referred to by the back pointer
    mutex locked. This could in very rare conditions lead to
    an invalid memory access.

  * Added a script command to the msi installer "afs_replace"
    which can be used to replace one version of OpenAFS with
    another without requiring an uninstall and reinstall if
    the installed msi is no longer in its original location.

  * Apparently the problem with multi-domain forests with cross-
    realm trusts to non-Windows realms was not entirely solved.
    The authentication to the AFS SMB service failed because 
    the wrong name was being used.  Using ASU as an example,
    the authentication was being performed with the name
    "QAAD\user" (an account in the forest root) and not 
    "user@ASU.EDU (the MIT Kerberos principal used to login with)

    The solution was to add an additional dependency on KFW
    in order or to be able to easily obtain the client principal 
    name stored in the MSLSA ccache TGT.  This information is 
    used in two locations:  

    - the pioctl() function 

    - a new WinLogon Event Handler for the "logon" event.  

    The pioctl function will now be able to use the correct
    name when calling WNetAddConnection2() and the "logon"
    event handler will now be able to call WNetAddConnection2().
    The hope is that the "logon" event handler will be called 
    before the profile is loaded but I have not guarrantee
    that will happen. 

Since 1.3.80:
  * Fixed a locking error in cm_TryBulkStat() which had the
    potential of deadlocking the system for the length of time
    it takes to perform a bulk status fetch operation.

  * Replaced time conversion code (UnixTime <-> FILETIME) to 
    be completely arithmetic instead of relying on a bizarre
    algorithm involving a variety of C RTL time functions.
    This has the side effect that UnixTime and FILETIME which
    are both stored in UTC are interpretted as UTC throughout
    the year.  Windows will apply the same localization to AFS
    as it does to NTFS.  Applications which rely on the ability
    to sync files between the two file systems will no longer
    see the timestamps of files in AFS change an hour relative
    to the files stored in NTFS or Windows based backup devices.

  * Fixed a invalid memory access under a bizarre circumstance.
    Windows will allow a physical mass media device to be 
    installed via Plug N Play to the system and will assign it
    the lowest available drive letter.  This is true even if the
    drive letter is currently assigned in the user session to
    a network device via NET USE (or its equivalent.)  When this
    happens, queries sent to the CIFS server will contain invalid
    data.  This invalid data was not being caught by the AFS 
    Client Service and was resulting in a crash when Freelance
    mode was in use.  

  * Fixed a reference count error when registering callbacks
    on a stat cache object if the callback was already registered

  * Add a case to cm_Analyze() in order to handle the case where
    cm_GetConnByMServers() returns CM_ERROR_NOSUCHVOLUME because
    the server list for the volume is empty.  In this case, force
    an update of the volume info and retry.

  * Insert a missing cm_EndCallbackGrantingCall() which could
    result in threads waiting for a callback to complete to never
    be woken up.

  * In the persistent cache, there is a maximum number of volume
    entries.  Allow volume entries to be reused if the maximum
    number have been allocated and their reference count is zero.

  * If we already have a dead virtual connection object, don't 
    ignore the fact that additional dead vc objects must be taken
    care of.

  * Removed a deadlock condition introduced in the summer of 2004.
    Do not hold mx locks around calls to RX functions including
    rx_NewCall().  That is what reference counts on the rx_connection
    object are for.

  * Fixed an initialization error in afslogon.dll which could
    result in random behavior including a failure to terminate
    the NPLogon function. (1.3.80b)

  * Fixed an error preventing the use of SMB authentication
    on Windows 2000.  (1.3.80a)

Since 1.3.77:
  * Updated CellServDB to Public CellServDB 16 Mar 2005

  * Fixed DNS AFSDB queries to ensure that "csail" cannot be
    misinterpretted as "csail.mit.edu" when the resolver 
    is configured to append ".mit.edu" to failed DNS queries.

  * Fixed another case in which the client would replace connections
    to the host when it was not necessary.  In this case the 
    situation would occur if cryptall was on and the connections
    were unauthenticated due to lack of an appropriate token.

  * OpenAFS for Windows has failed to work at sites which are 
    utilizing a cross-realm trust between an MIT/Heimdal realm
    and a multi-domain Windows forest when the workstation being
    accessed is not located in the root domain.  This is caused 
    by a bug in the workstation which was triggered after the 
    introduction of Windows 2003 Server.  When the bug is triggered,
    the workstation attempts to authenticate users to afsd_service.exe
    by contacting the Domain Controller instead of using the 
    LSA loopback authentication mechanism.

    One of the reasons this bug occurs is because the workstation    
    does not have a reliable way of knowing that the service whose
    netbios name is "AFS" is located on the workstation.  This will
    be fixed starting in Longhorn Beta 1 by Microsoft.  The 
    "BackConnectionHostNames" registry value will be used to 
    indicate that the authentications to that service name should
    be performed using the loopback authentication mechanism.

    In the meantime, when Logon Caching is enabled, we can force
    afsd_service.exe to authenticate using the logon cache before
    contacting the Domain Controller.  This will work with both
    password and smart card based logons.  

  * The allDown logic in cm_ConnByMServers() was wrong.  The allDown
    flag should not be cleared if a volume's server reference is 
    marked as "offline".  In the case where all of the volume's 
    servers are either "down" or the volumes are "offline", we want
    cm_Analyze() to process the condition as CM_ERROR_ALLOFFLINE
    instead of as CM_ERROR_TIMEDOUT.  In fact, CM_ERROR_TIMEDOUT
    should never occur in practice.

    In the case of CM_ERROR_ALLOFFLINE, cm_Analyze() will sleep for
    5 seconds, clear the server down and volume busy flags, and 
    then force an update from the VLDB.  This allows the client to 
    update the location of a volume if the reason for it being 
    marked offline is because it is being moved.  Calls to 
    cm_ConnByMServers() will be retried either until success or
    the RDRtimeout period is reached.

  * Correct the Power Management code behavior in response to 
    Standby, Suspend, and Shutdown events.  Instead of flushing the
    buffers associated with the mounted SMB submounts, simply write
    all buffers which are marked dirty.

  * Added support for "TheseCells" to afslogon.dll.  "TheseCells"
    provides a list of cells other than the default cell for which
    tokens should be obtained using the default Kerberos principal.
    This functionality is logon domain specific and is only available
    when using KFW for authentication.

  * Fixed FindNext Invalid Handle error caused by over agressive 
    attempts at garbage collecting dirSearch entries when the 
    dirSearch ID wraps from the maximum value to 1.

  * Add support for registry defined server preferences for VLDB and 
    File servers.  See registry.txt for details.

  * Increased default cache size to 96MB and default number of cache
    entries to 10,000.

  * Fixed refCount leaks related to directory lookups and pioctl calls.

  * Callbacks revoked during a race condition with an attempt to 
    obtain the same callback no longer result in an inaccessible
    stat cache entry.

  * New command line tool:

        afsdacl : Set or reset the DACL to allow starting or stopping
             the afsd service by any ordinary user.

        Usage : afsdacl [-set | -reset] [-show]
              -set   : Sets the DACL
              -reset : Reset the DACL
              -show  : Show current DACL (SDSF)

  * IP addresses are no longer queried once at startup.  Instead IP
    addresses are obtained as needed.   Loopback adapter addresses are
    no longer published to the server.

  * Pay attention to the MIT KFW registry configuration for automatic
    importation of MSLSA credentials. (SOFTWARE\MIT\Leash32,MsLsaImport)

  * Fix (once again) case-sensitive comparisons which was apparently 
    broken in 1.3.72.

  * Activate support for vos listvol -format

  * Population of the "AFS Client Admins" group failed on non-English
    versions of Windows because the name of the "Administrators" group
    is localized.  Now we lookup the name of the group by using the
    Administrators Group Alias Relative ID.

  * Multiple cell token acquisition within afscreds.exe was broken in the 
    case of Kerberos 5 cross realm authentication.  Instead of contacting
    the KDC associated with the cell's realm, afscreds would obtain a 
    token from the KDC of the user's realm.  This would result in
    "invalid kvno errors" while authenticating to the AFS servers.  
    Unauthenticated access would work.  The symptoms would vary based upon
    whether or not the VLDB servers had been contacted using unauthenticated
    connections prior to the user obtaining tokens.

  * The list of ACL entries was becoming corrupted.  It appears as if 
    an ACL when it expires was not being appropriately cleaned up.  In
    fact, it was left in the list of ACLs associated with the scache 
    entry.

  * Changed the default @sys name list to "x86_win32 i386_w2k i386_nt40"
    for 32-bit x86 systems.  The default for itanium will be "ia64_win64"
    and "amd64_win64" for amd 64-bit processors.

  * When executing executables, Windows provides a mechanisms by which
    the normal search for DLLs can be bypassed.  If a file foo.exe is
    being executed and there exists a file or directory "foo.exe.local" 
    (the contents are ignored if a file), then Windows will search for
    DLLs first in the "foo.exe.local" directory and second in the 
    directory in which the "foo.exe" file is located.  

    Previous releases of OAFW would improperly return 
    STATUS_NOT_A_DIRECTORY instead of the expected 
    STATUS_OBJECT_PATH_NOT_FOUND.  This would cause the Windows SMB client
    to terminate the search for the DLL causing the execution of the 
    application to fail.

  * Rework the reference counting of smb_vc_t objects.  The references  
    stored in the waiting locks were not counted.  This could result in
    an assertion if the reference count drops to zero.

  * "fs wscell" returns "Freelance.Local.Root" for the workstation cell
    when running in freelance mode.

  * Added support for persistent caching of file contents, stat entries,
    volume data, cell data, and name lookup data.  When the registry 
    value, "NonPersistentCaching", is not defined or set to 0 the file 
    specified by "CachePath" becomes a persistent cache file.   The 
    size of the cache file is computed at run time.  It has a maximum
    size of approximately 1.2GB.  The contents of the file will be 
    validated according to the rules specified by the "ValidateCache"
    registry value.  

  * Added support for UUIDs.  UUIDs are kept for as long as the 
    cache file is intact.

  * Added cmdebug.exe and support cache manager debugging callback 
    interfaces in afsd_service.exe.

    Usage: cmdebug -servers <server machine> [-port <IP port>] [-long] 
                   [-addrs] [-cache] [-help]
    Where: -long   print all info
           -addrs  print only host interfaces
           -cache  print only cache configuration

  * Symlinks to \\AFS\[all\]... will now be treated the same as 
    symlinks to /afs/....   However, please use /afs/... as otherwise
    the symlinks won't work on Unix.
  
  * Correct a problem with local CellID allocation for cells whose 
    server list is obtained via DNS instead of a CellServDB file.  If
    the DNS information expires the CellID assigned to the entry will
    be changed.  This causes all of the cm_scache_t objects which refer
    to the old cellID number to become useless.  Attempts to access 
    files or directories with cm_scache_t objects using the old cellID
    will fail since the server list cannot be obtained.

  * Correct deadlock condition in cm_EndCallbackGrantingCall which can
    be triggered if the volume referenced by the cm_scache_t object is
    offline.

  * The AFS Service needs to respond to SERVICE_ACCEPT_SHUTDOWN messages
    in addition to SERVICE_ACCEPT_STOP.

  * Move RPC shutdown until after the SMB and RX shutdown procedures 
    complete.  Block until RPC shutdown is complete.

  * Modify afslogon.dll (integrated logon) to wait for service if its
    state is START_PENDING.  If the timeout period occurs, reset to 
    the retry interval and not the sleep interval.

  * When renewing the server list for a cell obtained via DNS AFSDB
    records, the cm_cell_t entry must be removed from the list of all 
    cells.  Otherwise, the list of cells will be corrupted.
 
  * In the dcache and scache modules, use the cm_scache_t dataVersion
    instead of the cm_fakeDirVersion.  

  * Synchronize fs.c with the unix version.

  * The variable used to determine whether a file or virtual memory
    mapped cache is used was not properly initialized to a default
    value. If the registry setting "NonPersistentCaching" was not
    set, the choice would be random.   Properly initialized to be
    "file".

  * The memory mapped view was never unmapped before closing the file
    at service shutdown.  This is now properly cleaned up.

  * Default location of Cache file is now %TEMP%\AFSCache

Since 1.3.76:

  * A bug affecting new installations of 1.3.75/76 would result in
    the creating of incorrect mountpoints in the freelance root.afs 
    volume for the default cell.

    If "fs \\afs\all\<cellname>" lists a volume name of "root" instead
    of "root.cell", you have been affected by the bug.  To correct the
    problem, execute the following commands:

          fs rmmount \\afs\all\<cellname>
          fs rmmount \\afs\all\.<cellname>
        
          fs mkmount \\afs\all\<cellname> root.cell <cellname>
          fs mkmount \\afs\all\.<cellname> root.cell <cellname> -rw

Since 1.3.75:

  * A bug has been fixed in the auto-generation of Freelance root.afs
    symlinks which produced random entries in the \\AFS\all directory.

  * Support has been added for multi-homed servers

Since 1.3.74:
  * Added a new registry value, "StoreAnsiFilenames", which can be used
    to force the use of ANSI character sets instead of OEM Code Pages.
    This feature is useful when users require the ability to create 
    filenames with 8-bit characters and need to access the files from
    both Latin-1 based Unix systems as well as from Windows.

    Activation of this feature will prevent access to files stored with
    8-bit OEM characters.

  * Shutdown all SMB threads in a synchronized manner when stopping the 
    service.
 
  * There is currently a maximum cache size of 1.3GB.  The limit is imposed
    by the largest contiguous block of unused memory within the 2GB process
    space which can be assigned to the memory mapped file.  Unfortunately,
    when the executable digital signature verification code is activated
    Windows sees fit to further segment the process memory which in turn
    reduces the size of the maximum cache file to less then 800MB.  If
    larger cache sizes are desired, a new registry value should be set:

      HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client (DWORD) "VerifyServiceSignature" = 0x0

    Setting this value will disable the runtime verification of digital
    signatures on afsd_service.exe and the afs dlls which it loads.  It
    will not disable the the version number check on those same files.
    The signature verification is not a security messure and is only meant
    to enhance the ability to afsd_service.exe to detect potential
    destablizing mixtures of DLLs from incompatible distributions.

    Added code to auto-disable the signature verification check if 
    the desired cache size is greater then 700MB.

  * Windows' WinTrustVerify(WIN_SPUB_ACTION_PUBLISHED_SOFTWARE) is 
    used to verify the validity of the afsd_service.exe binary 
    as well as each of the AFS DLLs loaded by the service.  Not only
    must the digital signature be valid but the signatures of the 
    DLL must be signed by the same entity as the service.

  * Implement new functions: cm_freelanceMountPointExists and
    cm_freelanceSymlinkExists.  Use them along with other validity
    checks in cm_freelanceAddMount and cm_freelanceAddSymlink to
    ensure that name collisions do not occur and that empty strings
    are not valid file names.

    A symlink may not have a name which would resolve to a valid 
    cell name.  Doing so would prevent access to the cell.

  * Add missing cm_HoldSCacheNoLock call to Freelance mount point
    re-initialization code.  The reference counts of the fake root.afs
    volume scache object(s) would become invalid when the mount point
    or symlink lists were altered.

  * Add registry entries to provide mappings from the afsdsbmt.ini
    to the new locations for applications which count on the use
    of the old Profile file APIs.  These apps are likely to fail
    if the user does not have administrator privileges and the 
    registry is locked down.

  * The afs_config.exe submounts dialog had two errors.  
    First, attempts to remove entries failed because the registry
    key was being opened without KEY_WRITE privileges.  
    Second, when editing a submount entry, changing the name
    would add a new key and leave the original one in place. 
    Now the original submount will be removed if its name is 
    changed.

  * In recent months there have been several incidents in which
    users have experienced problems starting or accessing 
    afsd_service.exe and after significant effort has been spent
    it has turned out that they have two versions of AFS on the
    machine or an inconsistent set of DLLs.  

    Code has now been added to afsd_service.exe which will walk
    the list of modules loaded by afsd_service.exe and validate
    that the version of the AFS DLLs matches the version of the
    afsd_service.exe executable.  If they do not match the service
    will not start.  

  * When Freelance mode is enabled and there is no registry
    key HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Freelance, afsd_service.exe
    will attempt to import the afs_freelance.ini file contents.
    If the file does not exist, it was creating a dummy file
    with a r/o and r/w entry for the default cell and then
    importing those values.

    This process has been changed.  The temporary file is no
    longer created.   Also, both the OpenAFS Client install
    directory as well as %WINDIR% are checked for previous
    afs_freelance.ini files.

  * Added support for VL_GetEntryByNameN().  Still need to add
    support for VL_GetEntryByNameU() for multi-homed support.

  * Fix a deadlock situation in afscreds.exe when canceling an
    auto-generated Obtain Tokens dialog

Since 1.3.72/73:
  * Fix the locking of objects during Directory Searches in the
    SMB/CIFS server.  The failure to properly lock the reference 
    counts was resulting in the premature freeing of smb_dirSearch_t 
    objects while they were still in use by the SMB/CIFS client.
    This does not solve the "Invalid Handle" problem.

  * Fix Find Cell By Name pioctl call to return a valid cell
    name for the Freelance fake root.afs volume.  
    "Freelance.Local.Root".

  * Fix the Explorer Shell Extension Symlinks->Add operation.
    The dialog template was missing and the link destination
    string was too short.

  * Add support for symlinks to Freelance root.afs volume
    Stored at HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Freelance\Symlinks
       <number>  =  "<linkname>:<relative-path>."
    Use symlink.exe to create, list, or remove

  * Remove the fallback to the use of KFW's KRB4 library when obtaining
    tokens.  We never obtain KRB4 tickets.

  * Fix AFS Client Configuration Control Panel to support new SysName
    protocol.

  * Fix a bug in afsd_service.exe which could result in the SysName
    not being read from the registry.

Since 1.3.71:
  * Add code to block the issuance of AFS tokens by aklog.exe or
    afscreds.exe when the Kerberos 5 principal name contains a dot.

  * Modify the IsAdmin() function to always treat the local SYSTEM
    account as an AFS client administrator.  Affects fs.exe and 
    afs_config.exe.

  * Modify the internal handling of Quota Exceeded errors

  * Upgrade all reference count fields in the Windows cache manager
    and the osi library to use unsigned long instead of signed short.
    A similar fix has been applied to the afs rpc (rx) library.

  * fix the Windows cache manager to prevent it from replacing the 
    rx_connection object associated with the cm_conn_t object on each
    and every operation if "fs crypt" was set.  This explains the 
    dramatic performance difference when crypt is used vs clear.
    The problem: 'cryptall', a boolean flag indicating whether or not 
    "fs crypt" is set, was being compared to the rx_connection 
    cryptlevel which is either rxkad_clear:0 or rxkad_crypt:2.
    1 != 2 and therefore the rx_connection was always destroyed 
    and replaced on each and every operation.

    Lock the cm_conn_t object around every call to RXAFS_xxxx functions.
    It is not safe for the cm_conn_t object to not be locked because
    rx_DestroyConnection might be called from another thread if:
        - the user's tokens have changed or expired
        - the crypt mode has changed

    This fix appears to have also taken care of the problems associated
    with Overlapped Writes resulting in Delayed Write errors.

  * fix NSIS installer's AdminGroup.exe to properly create and
    remove groups when given -create or -remove.  The string comparison
    test was wrong.

  * fs sysname now accepts a list of sysname values 

  * added a new registry value HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client "IoctlDebug"
    DWORD which when set to a non-zero value will cause error message
    text to be output to stderr from the pioctl() routine.  Useful in 
    debugging failures of fs.exe, tokens.exe, etc.

  * added a test to the power management code to only perform a 
    flush operation if there is at least one network adapter which
    is not a loopback adapter.

  * Fix bug in loading of registry value HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client
    "EnableKFW".  This value will not be read if the key
    HKCU\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client exists; even if the "EnableKFW" 
    value under that key does not.

  * provide mechanisms to force the use of krb524d for Kerberos 5
    ticket to AFS token conversion.  For afslogon.dll and afscreds.exe
    there is a new registry value "Use524" and for aklog.exe a new
    command line parameter "-m".

  * Fix the pattern matching algorithm to properly match patterns
    ending with a '*'.

  * smb_ReceiveCoreRename() was factored to produce smb_Rename()
    which is used by both the original function and the new
    smb_ReceiveNTRename().  smb_ReceiveNTRename() supports the
    creation of HardLinks in addition to Renaming.  smb_Link() 
    is a new function which creates HardLinks via cm_Link().
    cm_Link() is a new vnodeops function which creates links
    using RXAFS_Link().

    smb_ReceiveNTRename() does not support the File Copy and 
    Move Cluster Information operations described in its interface.
    ReceiveNTRename is under documented in CIFS-TR-1p00_FINAL.pdf.

  * When opening files via symlinks, we should follow the symlinks
    until we reach the actual file stat cache entry.  The stat cache
    entry of the file should then be stored in the FID instead of
    stat scache entry of the symlink.

  * return bad operation errors for all unimplemented functions
    even if we do not know the functions exist.

  * Log bad packets and unknown operation packets to the trace log

  * Map CM_ERROR_BADOP to STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED instead of 
    0xC09820FF
  
  * Update list of known CIFS operations to include all those listed
    in CIFS-TR-1p00_FINAL.pdf.

  * Modify the handling of HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Submounts
    to support the REG_EXPAND_SZ type.

Since 1.3.70:
  * A new Windows authorization group "AFS Client Admins" is now 
    created and populated with the members of the "Administrators"
    group.  The group is used to determine which accounts on the
    machine may be used to modify the AFS Client Configuration via
    the UI and command line tools.  afs_config.exe, fs.exe, 

  * Modify the WinLogon Logoff Event Handler to query NT4 domain
    controllers for the remote profile path if Active Directory
    services are not available.

  * Fix aklog.exe to not add the AFS ID to the username

  * PTS registration of new users to foreign cells has been added to 
     afscreds.exe

  * The cm_Daemon thread is used to perform checks for 
    down servers, up servers, volumes, callback expirations, 
    lock maintenance and token expiration.  Due to a gaff in
    larger integer division the thread never performed any 
    work.  Instead the current time computation would always
    be less then the trigger times.  This had an adverse affect
    on the client's ability to maintain communication with servers,
    keep volumes up to date, and flush user tokens and acls
    when they have expired. This was broken when the 1.3 branch
    was modified to support VC7 which no longer included 
    largeint.lib

  * An initialization problem with the Freelance code was 
    detected while fixing the callbackRequest.  The cm_rootSCachep
    object is obtained during afsd_InitDaemons() but the callback 
    information is incomplete.  The callback information will not
    be obtained until cm_MergeStatus is called from within
    cm_GetCallback.  Unfortunately, cm_SyncOp did not properly 
    test for the conditions under which the callback information
    must be obtained.  

  * Reports have been filed indicating that callbacks were
    being lost.  An examination of the code indicated that the
    cm_server_t objects were not being properly reference
    counted by the cm_scache_t and cm_callbackRequest_t objects.
    In particular, the cm_server_t objects may have been freed
    from beneath the cm_conn_t objects.

    All of the reference counting is now done via the functions:
        cm_GetServer
        cm_GetServerNoLock
        cm_PutServer
        cm_PutServerNoLock
    this improves the ability to track the referrals.  

    Each cm_BeginCallbackGranting Call now allocates a reference
    to the cm_server_t.  The cm_EndCallbackGrantingCall either
    frees the reference or transfers it to the cm_scache_t
    cbServerp field.  These are then appropriately tracked
    through the cm_Analyze call.

  * Ensure that the dnlc hash table is the same size as the
    dir name hash table (as per original author's note).
    Increase the dnlc CM_AFSNCNAMESIZE to a multiple of 8
    for compatibility with 64-bit systems.

  * fix smb_ApplyV3DirListPatches to properly apply the hidden
     attribute to dotfiles when the infoLevel < 0x101 and 
     cm_SyncOp has failed.

  * Fix the Freelance registry initialization code.  There
    was a possibility that some systems could end up with 
    garbage in the registry during a clean install.

Since 1.3.66:
   * file and directory names beginning with "." will now be given the
     hidden attribute when the volume access is anonymous.  this matches
     the behavior when the volume access is via an authenticated user.

   * Added a change monitor to the HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Freelance
     key.  When a change occurs mark the root.afs data as invalid and
     for it to be reloaded on the next access.  This allows administrators
     to modify the mount point list without restarting the service.
     
     The freelance client used to provide a fake modification time for
     the root.afs volume data and its mount points of 7/09/2001 14:24 EDT.
     Added code to extract the last modification time of the Freelance
     registry key and use that instead.  The time now represents the 
     most recent mount point change.

   * PTS registration of new users to foreign cells has been added to 
     aklog.exe

   * Additional Cache Control and Credential Manager options have been
     added to the WiX installer.  See deployment guide for details.

   * The CachePath setting is now optionally a REG_EXPAND_SZ type
  
   * The WiX installer has been upgraded.  Version 2.0.1927.1 is now 
     required.

   * The loopback installation code may have had a problem updating the
     %ETC%\HOSTS file which could have resulted in a premature failure.
     Work around code has been added for the case where the file cannot
     be deleted.

   * The default max chunksize was increased from 15 (32K) to 17 (128K)
     because Windows sends 64K blocks when using overlapped writes.

   * The default number of server threads was increased from 4 to 25 to
     better handle overlapped writes.  

   * The "AfscredsShortcutParams" registry value was not being properly
     loaded by afscreds.exe.  Therefore, the default value was always being
     used instead of the value set by the installer.

   * Windows XP provides downgrade attack detection to prevent an attacker
     from being able to force the use of NTLM simply by disrupting 
     communication with the KDC.  This attack cannot exist between the 
     Windows CIFS client and the AFS Client Service.  Therefore, when a
     downgrade has been detected the afs pioctl library will force the 
     establishment of a new CIFS connection using NTLM.
 
   * A locking error was discovered surrounding all references to volume
     server lists within the cm_cell.c source file. 

   * The logged into Windows username was incorrect on Terminal Server
     machines.

   * A new registry value "NonPersistentCaching" was added to the service
     parameters key.  When set to a non-zero value, the afs cache is stored
     in the Windows paging file.  There are two limitations to choosing
     this option: 
        1. when persistent caching is implemented it won't work with 
           this flag set since there will be nothing to persist.
        2. with this flag set the initial paging allocation cannot be
           changed while the service is running

   * An initialization bug was discovered in aklog.exe which affected users
     who have a domain name for their afs servers which could not be mapped
     to a realm

Since 1.3.65:
   * afs_config.exe now validates cell names against DNS in addition
     to the CellServDB file.

   * In order to allow the freelance client to connect to a volume with ID 
     equal to 1 on the default cell we changed the fake root.afs volume ID
     once again.  This time we choose 0xFFFFFFFF.  In addition, we change
     the cell ID of the fake root.afs volume from 1 to 0xFFFFFFFF as well.
     It will now be impossible for a volume ID to match that of another 
     cell unless the client is connected to 0xFFFFFFFD cells.  That should
     be enough room for growth.

   * Fix "fs mkmount" command to work with UNC paths and when
     started from non-AFS drives.  It is now possible to create a mount
     point in the freelance fake root.afs volume with the command

        fs mkmount \\AFS\all\<directory-name> <volume-name> <cellname>

     For example,
        
        fs mkmount \\AFS\all\openafs.org root.cell openafs.org
        fs mkmount \\AFS\all\.openafs.org root.cell openafs.org -rw

   * The algorithm used to re-attempt access to the servers associated with
     a volume has been altered to properly address the case in which all 
     servers have been marked down.  The previous algorithm did not reset
     the server's down flags so the servers were never actually retried.
     This caused a problem with active volumes if the network connectivity
     was lost as could be the case with a network cable removal, wireless
     drop, or laptop hibernation.  With the fix volume access is restored
     almost instantenously when network connectivity becomes available.

   * Support for SMB/CIFS browsing has been added to the AFS Client Service
     SMB server.  It is now possible to use "NET VIEW \\AFS" to obtain a
     listing of AFS submounts and freelance mount points.  Support for
     NETSHAREENUM, NETSHAREGETINFO, NETSERVERENUM2, NETSERVERGETINFO
     significantly enhances the behavior of AFS volumes within the Explorer
     Shell.  For instance, "AFS" now shows up as server in the Explorer
     with each submount or freelance mount point visible as a share.
     The right click menu in each folder now works with full functionality
     on a consistent basis.

   * The network provider can be configured to have different behavior
     depending on the domain that the user logs into.  These settings are
     only relevant when using integrated login.  A domain refers to an
     Active Directory (AD) domain, a trusted Kerberos (non-AD) realm or the
     local machine (i.e. local account logins).  The domain name that is
     used for selecting the domain would be the domain that is passed into
     the NPLogonNotify function of the network provider. (see registry.txt
     for details)

   * Added a new registry value [HKCU\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client] 
     "Authentication Cell" which may be used to specify a default 
     authentication cell for afscreds.exe which is different from
     the default cell for the AFS Client Service daemon.

   * Added a Logoff WinLogon Event Notification function to afslogon.dll.
     afslogon.dll moved to %WINDIR%\System32\.
     New registry entries added to register the dll for Winlogon events.

     The logoff event will now force a call to ktc_ForgetAllTokens()
     using the context of the user being logged off as long as the 
     user's profile is not loaded from within AFS.  If the profile 
     was loaded from AFS we can't release the tokens since the Logoff
     event is triggered prior to the profile being written back to 
     the its source location.  This is now performed in an XP SP2 
     safe manner.

   * Windows XP SP2 Internet Connection Firewall interoperability
     has been added.

   * The %WINDIR%\afsdsbmt.ini contains four sections:
        Submounts, Drive Mappings, Active Maps and CSC Policies.
     The Submounts and CSC policies are now stored in the registry under
        [HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Submounts]
        [HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\CSCPolicy]
     The Drive Mappings and Active Maps are stored in the registry under
        [HKCU\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Mappings]
        [HKCU\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Active Maps]

     There is no automatic migration of this data as it would be impossible
     to consistently migrate data to user profiles which may not be active
     when the machine is updated.

   * The %WINDIR%\afs_freelance.ini contains lists of mountpoints for the
     fake root.afs volume.  For the same reasons as for the cellservdb file,
     this information should not be in %WINDIR%.  This information is now
     kept under the registry key
        [HKLM\SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Freelance]

     The data from the afs_freelance.ini file will be automatically 
     migrated to the registry on first execution of afsd_service.exe

   * Keeping the CellServDB file in the location %WINDIR%\afsdcell.ini is 
     troublesome for several reasons.  One, it is confusing for those who
     expect the file to be named "CellServDB" instead of "afsdcell.ini".
     Two, this file is not a Windows Profile formatted file.  Three, 
     applications should not be reading or writing to %WINDIR%.  It causes
     problems for Windows Terminal Server.

     The new location of CellServDB will be the OpenAFS Client install 
     directory which is by default C:\Program Files\OpenAFS\Client and can
     be determined by querying the registry for 
     [HKLM\SOFTWARE\TransarcCorporation\AFS Client\CurrentVersion]PathName

     The existing afsdcell.ini will be migrated by the NSIS installer. 
     The Wix installer must still be updated to do the same.

   * Change NSIS installer to use DNS by default; to remove Integrated Logon
     High Security mode; and to add Terminal Services compatibility registry
     entries to allow the OpenAFS tools to find the afsdcell.ini and other
     configuration files in %WINDIR%.
  
   * Add support for authenticated SMB connections.   This will remove
     the need for high security mode in most situations.  Both NTLM
     and Extended Security (GSS SPNEGO) modes are supported.  Effectively,
     only NTLM can be used even though Kerberos is now supported.  The
     reason is that it is not possible to construct a service principal
     which is unique to each individual machine.

     SMB Extended Auth does not work on XP SP2 unless one of two registry
     modifications are made:

     (1) To disable the check for matching host names on loopback connections
        set this key.  This does not require a reboot:

        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa]
            "DisableLoopbackCheck"=dword:00000001

     (2) To add the AFS SMB/CIFS service name to an approved list.  This
        does require a reboot:

        [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\MSV1_0]
            "BackConnectionHostNames"=multi-sz "AFS" "MACHINE-AFS"

     afsd_service.exe will automatically add the current Netbios Name
     to the BackConnectionHostNames list and then temporarily disable
     the loopback check for one cycle of startup/shutdown of the service.
     We assume most folks do not start/stop without a reboot so this 
     will be adequate in most cases.

   * Fix security hole in afslogon.dll which allowed passwords to be
     sent in clear text to the KDC in a misformed principal name.

   * Fix cm_GetCell() to properly handle expired dns entries
     without crashing

   * If Freelance mode is active and the afs_freelance.ini
     file does not exist, do not create an empty file.
     Instead create a file containing ro and rw mountpoints
     to the default cell using the standard conventions.

   * Modify the Freelance support to handle the ability
     to create rw mount points in the fake root.afs volume.

   * Changed the RPC mechanism used for token setting from 
     named pipes to local.  Use of named pipes can be restored
     by setting the environment variable AFS_RPC_PROTSEQ to
     "ncacn_np". 

     Named pipes were required when a Windows 9x system was
     using a NT system in gateway mode which is incompatible
     with our use of local loopback adapters.

   * In afscreds.exe, if a username of the form user@REALM is
     specified and no password is specified, do not perform a 
     kinit operation.  Only perform the aklog functionality.

   * Add a new registry value which allows the number of processors
     on which afsd_service.exe executes to be restricted.  Valid
     values are 1..numOfProcessors

       HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TransarcAfsDaemon\Parameters
          (DWORD) MaxCPUs 

Since 1.3.64:
   * A second MSI based installer option is now available.

   * Fixed Kerberos 5 kinit functionality in afscreds.exe to properly
     request tickets for user/instance@REALM instead of just user@REALM

   * Modify the Power Management Notify routine to wait for the Hard Dead
     timeout period instead of a fixed 19 seconds.  With the longer timeout
     periods Hibernation and Standby could never succeed when network 
     connectivity is not available.

   * The following fs.exe commands are now restricted to Administrator:
     - checkservers with a non-zero timer value
     - setcachesize
     - newcell
     - sysname with a new sysname list
     - exportafs 
     - setcell
     - setserverprefs
     - storebehind
     - setcrypt
     - cscpolicy
     - trace

     setting the default sysname for a machine should be done via the
     registry and not via "fs sysname".

   * NSIS installer adds options to install Debugging Symbols
     and the Microsoft Loopback Adapter; the user is now also
     given the ability to select the afscreds.exe startup options.

   * Build system modified to generate symbols for FREE (aka RELEASE)
     builds as well as CHECKED (aka DEBUG) builds

   * Sites which have a volume ID of 0x20000001 assigned to their
     root.cell volumes have been experiencing problems with accessing
     the root.cell volume of their cell when Freelance mode has been
     active.  This was because 0x20000001 was assigned to the fake
     root.afs volume created by freelance.  The fake volume id is
     now set to 0x00000001 to prevent conflicts.

   * The timeout logic in the AFS Client Service has been wrong
     for sometime.  It is based on two different assumptions.
     First, the SMB client timeout is a fix value as was the case
     with OS/2 Lan Manager.  This assumption is incorrect.  The
     SMB timeout in Windows is a dynamic value computed based upon
     a fixed minimum timeout to which is added time based upon the
     size of the request and the performance characteristics of
     the connection.  Second, it is the responsibility of the 
     SMB Server to enforce the timeout requirements of the client.
     This is untrue.  The SMB Server cannot be expected to know
     the requirements of the client.  More importantly, if the 
     SMB server uses the SMB client timeout as a value to restrict
     its behavior as an RX client, the performance characteristics
     of the local SMB session would be used to prematurely terminate
     WAN connections with significantly different performance 
     characteristics.

     The timeout logic has therefore been modified in the following
     manner:
      . the Lan Manager Workstation (SMB) Session Timeout is used only
        as a basis for configuring the Connection Dead Timeout 
        and Hard Dead Timeout values.  The Connection Dead Timeout
        must be at least 15 seconds longer than the SMB Timeout
        and the Hard Dead Timeout must be at least double the 
        Connection Dead Timeout.
      . New registry entries have been added to allow the Connection
        Dead Timeout and Hard Dead Timeout values independent of the
        Lan Manager Workstation Session Timeout
      . The test to enforce the SMB Client Timeout has been removed.
        
     One of the side-effects of removing the enforcement of the SMB 
     Client Timeout is that regardless of whether or not the SMB client
     is available to receive the response (and how would the SMB server
     know) the RX protocol response can be used to update the AFS 
     Client Service state for ready access by future SMB client 
     requests.

     This should be the end of the "Server paused or restarting messages"
   
   * Add support for arbitrary UNC paths to the pioctl() support.
     This enables the fs commands as well as the AFS Shell Extension
     to work correctly when UNC paths are being used.

   * Fix afscreds.exe (by updating afskfw.lib) to search for cells via
     DNS if the cell configuration cannot be determined via CellServDB

   * Add debug info to test whether CM_BUF_WAITING or CM_SCACHE_WAITING
     are ever set more than once at a time
 
   * Fix the management of lists of cm_cell_t structures when using 
     DNS to lookup cell information.  The previous code would fail to
     reuse the same cellID for a cell if DNS was used more than once
     for a given cell name.  When the ttl expired, a single cm_cell_t
     could be inserted into the cm_allCellsp list more than once 
     producing a loop.  In addition, the vlServerp list belonging to
     the cell was not freed resulting in improper refCounting of the
     servers.

   * Add DNS support to cm_IoctlNewCell() which previous only examined
     the CellServDB file

   * Add cm_FreeServer() function and call it from cm_FreeServerList()
     to properly garbage collect cm_server_t objects 
     
   * Add numVCs variable to smb.c to track the number of smb_vc_t 
     objects created and use it to initialize the vcID field which 
     previously was set to 0 in all objects resulting in FindByID 
     collisions.

   * Fixed DNS lookups to work consistently throughout the OpenAFS
     product instead of just from within the afsd_service.exe

   * Added a runtime check to ensure that AFS Client Service SMB
     Server is accepting connections before attempting to mount
     global drives.

   * Read IP addresses for volume servers out of the CellServDB
     file if gethostbyname() on the hostname fails.

   * Fix getcellconfig() to populate both the Hostnames as well
     as IP addresses when loading cell data via DNS

   * Increase the Connection Dead Time to 50 from 20 seconds
     Increase the Hard Dead Time to 120 from 40 seconds
     (matches the Unix values)

   * Fixed an assertion validating the number of allocated NCBs

   * Fixed the build environment to consistently build for 
     Windows 2000 and above.  (APPVER = 5.0)

   * Fixed rx_debug to properly validate the receipt in incoming
     data with select() and recvfrom().  Do not copy data out of
     the socket buffer unless success is indicated.

Since 1.3.63:
   * afsd_service.exe will now display a message box to the 
     desktop when it terminates due to an IP Address Change.
  
   * installer no longer deletes AFS Server configuration data
     on uninstall

   * installer generates a warning dialog if the RPC service 
     is not properly configured

   * installer compressed with lzma instead of bzip2

   * afsd_service.exe shutdown crash solved once and for all
 
   * reference counting of smb_vc_t data structures improved
 
   * name space collision of smb_fid_t event objects corrected

   * the output of "fs memdump" is now written to 
     %WINDIR%\TEMP\afsd_alloc.log

   * the file TaAfsApp_1033.dll is now properly installed allowing
     the User Manager to start
  
   * a new algorithm is used for computing filename pattern matches

   * afscreds.exe now accepts user names containing instance
     fields.

   * Fix the Directory Name Lookup Cache to be case-sensitive.
     This is crucial in environments in which a Windows client
     is accessing a directory with more than one filename that
     differs only by case.  If the directory contains "FOO" 
     and "Foo".  You want "DEL Foo" to delete the correct one.
     We still have a problem in that "DEL foo" will delete a
     random filename.  This will be addressed in a future release.

   * Fix afscreds.exe -M option (renewMaps) to work when High
     Security mode is off.  Also, remember to disable the ActiveMap
     flag in afsdsbmt.ini when a drive mapping is removed.

   * Updates to NSIS installer script.  AFS Server configuration
     data will not be destroyed on un-install or re-install.  
     Use a better compression algorithm.
   
   * afslogon.dll now uses KFW to obtain tokens when available
   
   * afslogon.dll when given an all uppercase username will
     attempt to authenticate with both the uppercase name
     and an all lowercase variation

   * DST modification removed.  The fix appears to make things
     worse after a reboot of the machine.

   * fs.exe:  added "cscpolicy" which is used to 
     change client side caching policy for AFS shares

     Usage: fs cscpolicy [-share <AFS share>] [-manual] [-programs] 
                         [-documents] [-disable] [-help]

   * Several uninitialized variables have been initialized

   * It is now possible to obtain tokens using cross realm
     Kerberos within afscreds.exe:
        cell:      dementia.org
        user:      jaltman@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
        password:  xxxxxxxx
     Will obtain a cross realm ticket for jaltman/DEMENTIA.ORG@ATHENA.MIT.EDU
     will will in turn be used to obtain afs@DEMENTIA.ORG.
     The resulting token will be stored with the display name 
       jaltman@ATHENA.MIT.EDU@dementia.org

   * aklog.exe has been added to the client

     Usage: aklog [-d] [[-cell | -c] cell [-k krb_realm]] 
                  [[-p | -path] pathname]
                  [-noprdb] [-force]
                  [-5 | -4]

        -d gives debugging information.
        krb_realm is the kerberos realm of a cell.
        pathname is the name of a directory to which you wish to authenticate.
        -noprdb means don't try to determine AFS ID.
        -5 or -4 selects whether to use Kerberos V or Kerberos IV.
           (default is Kerberos V)
        No commandline arguments means authenticate to the local cell.

Since 1.3.62:
   * All of the resource files have been restructured to adhere to
     a set of rules IBM implemented for loading string resources.
     These rules had either been forgotten or were not discovered
     by folks working on the OpenAFS sources.  The end result was
     memory corruption.  This is primary item which was preventing
     the AFS Server from working.

   * Increased the size of the maximum ticket size stored in a token
     from 344 bytes to 12,000.  Increased the buffers used to convey
     messages between the pioctl() caller and the SMB Server from
     1000 bytes to 12,512.  The code appeared to have been writing
     above the top of the stack by quite a few number of bytes.
     (The increased ticket size is necessary for the next item.)

   * When obtaining AFS Tokens via KFW, krb524 is no longer required.
     Instead the raw Kerberos 5 ticket is used in its entirety.  This
     is extremely important as it allows us to use pure Kerberos 5 KDCs
     as the source of the AFS authentication.  The use of up to 12,000 byte
     tickets will allow tickets produced by all versions of Microsoft
     Active Directory to be used.
      - create a user account.       
      - designate it DES only
      - disable pre-auth
      - specify its UPN to be  "afs@realm"
      - assign a SPN of "afs/cellname" to the UPN with setspn.exe

   * Do not enforce the funky 8dot3 pattern matching rule that the first "."
     is special when using long file names.  (you must use "*.*" and not "*")
     Instead only enforce it when performing 8dot3 searches. 

   * Fixed the DST problem with creation times being set one hour ahead

   * Fixed the problem when using \\afs\cell-alias.  For example, 
     \\afs\uncc instead of \\afs\uncc.edu.  Do not a new cell struct
     for the alias name; instead simply expand the name.  One of the
     symptoms of this problem was a loss of acquired tokens.

   * Fixed the AFS Shell Extension.  The Symbolic Link menu was empty 
     of strings.  (Only English strings provided.)

   * Fixed the installer to properly replace in use files.  

   * Fixed the build system to cleanup generated component version files

   * The release build compiled with MSVC 6.0 compiler to avoid the 
     afsd_service.exe shutdown crash.  This does not solve the problem
     but simply avoids it for the time being.

Since 1.3.61:

 * fix afslogon.dll to not corrupt memory when High Security mode
   is not used.  

 * fix afsd_service.exe to not attempt to restore the stack when
   an exception occurs.  (not safe in multi-threaded programs)

 * fix uninstaller to properly remove the CRT and MFC DLLs
 
 * remove a Message Box from afscreds.exe when getcellconfig()
   fails on a kerberos realm which is not a cell

The following is a list of changes to the OpenAFS for Window client
since 1.3.60.

 * "fs setserverprefs" will leave afsd service deadlocked

 * "vos listaddrs" will core dump

 * installer sets the appropriate keys to support Integrated Logon

 * installer disables the "Find Lana by Name" functionality as it
   was causing headaches for many users

 * fix the intermittent crash of the power management thread when
   shutting down the AFS Client Service

 * optimizes the obtain drive mount list functionality which is 
   executed every time the mount tab in afscreds.exe and afs_config.exe
   are refreshed.  (this happens a lot)

 * fix the service shutdown logic.  add the STOP_PENDING state
   and do not accept additional service events after we declare
   ourselves STOPPED.

The following is a list of changes to the OpenAFS for Window client
since 1.2.10.

* flexelint was run against the source tree and hundreds (perhaps 
  thousands) of corrections were applied to ensure prototypes 
  were in use; types were used consistently; variables were 
  initialized; unused variables were removed; etc.

* A wide variety of instrumentation was added including the 
  ability to produce a stack trace from within afsd_service.exe
  when it crashes.

* Dynamic configuration of the RDRtimeout value based upon the
  LanMan Workstation Session Timeout

* The mount root no longer needs to be called "/afs".  This 
  is now set by a registry value "MountRoot" within the key
  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TransarcAFSDaemon\Parameters

* The cell list is now only read out of afsdcell.ini when the
  file changes instead of each time a cell is resolved.

* Thread synchronization was added to cm_server.c and ktc_nt.c

* All calls to GlobalAlloc()/GlobalFree() were replaced with 
  calloc()/free().  The Global functions were needed on Windows 3.x
  but have caused a variety of problems on the Win32 platforms.
  Avoiding them is highly recommended by several Microsoft 
  Knowledgebase articles

* Support for Symbolic Links added to the AFS Shell Extension

* Added a registry value "OverlayEnabled" to determine if
  Shell Extension Overlays should be enabled.  
  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TransarcAFSDaemon\Parameters

* New Build system to support VC6, VC.NET, VC.NET2003 compilers and
  separate trees for checked and free builds.  Build system supports
  a custom directory src\WINNT\extra which can be used as a grafting
  location of organization specific additions to the build tree.

* New installer built using NSIS 2.0.  

* Named all kernel objects in order to allow them to be monitored
  with tools such as SysInternals' ProcExp.exe.
  
* Introduced new EventLog framework for AFSD

* Introduced Power Management interface to AFSD for Standby and 
  Hibernate modes to allow cache to be flushed prior to network
  disconnect

* Utilize Win32 DNSQuery API instead of internal routines.  This 
  allows DNS SRV queries to be sent to all current domain name 
  servers.  Not just one specified in an INI file.  DNS is now
  always activated.

* "NetbiosName" registry value may be used to specify a fixed
  Netbios Name such as "AFS" to be used instead of "HOSTNAME-AFS"
  when the loopback adapter is in use.  If you need to use the 
  old notation with a loopback adapter installed specify a registry
  entry of 

     "NetbiosName" REG_EXPAND_SZ = "%COMPUTERNAME%-AFS"

* Refactor all modules which depend on LAN Adapter and NetbiosName
  determination in a new library: lanahelper.lib.  This allows for
  consistent behavior throughout the product.

* Move the afsd.log and afsd_init.log files to the directory specified
  by the "TEMP" environment variable.  This is usually %WINDIR%\TEMP
  for services.  Added the Date to the log entries.

* New registry value "RxMaxMTU" used to limit the size of the RX 
  packets sent by the AFS Client Service to the Server.  In order
  to enable OpenAFS to work across the Cisco IPSec VPN the packet
  size must be restricted to 1264 or smaller.  The latest NSIS
  installer sets a value of 1260 by default.

* New registry value "RxNoJumbo" to disable the use of Jumbo Rx
  packets.  This is not needed in order to work across the Cisco
  VPN but might be needed for other network environments.  This
  value is not set by the NSIS installer.

* New registry value "HideDotFiles" is used to apply the Hidden
  attribute to files whose names begin with a '.'.   This value
  is set by the NSIS installer.

* New registry value "MaxMpxRequests" allows the maximum number
  of multiplexed sessions to be configured at run time.  This
  value is not set by the NSIS installer.  The default value is
  50.

* New registry value "MaxVCPerServer" allows the maxmimum number
  of VCs per server to be configured at run time.  This value is
  not set by the NSIS installer.  The default value is 100.

* New registry value "AllSubmount" allows the "all" submount to
  be disabled by setting its value to 0x00.

* Allow cells names to be valid mount points 
    \\<netbiosName>\<cellname>

* Store the active state of drive mappings in order for afscreds.exe
  to restore them upon startup

* Add exception handling to generate a Stack Trace to the afsd_init.log
  file if one happens to occur.

* Add lots of logging to help detect the cause of invalid SMB packets

* Enable Kerberos for Windows to be used to obtain AFS Tokens via
  conversion of Kerberos 5 "afs" service tickets.  Supports auto-
  renewal of expiring tokens as long as afscreds.exe is running.

* New afscreds.exe command line options:
    -A = autoinit
    -M = renew drive maps
    -N = ip address change detection
    -Z = unmap drives

* New registry value "EnableKFW" in {HKCU,HKLM}SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client 
  determines whether or not MIT Kerberos for Windows should be used
  to obtain tokens via Kerberos 5 tickets.

* New registry value "AfscredsShortcutParams" in 
  {HKCU,HKLM}SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client 
  determines the command line parameters to be specified when "fixing"
  the AFS Shortcut in the user's startup folder.

* The "ShowTrayIcon" registry value has been moved from 
  HKLM\Software\TransarcCorporation\AFS Client\AfsCreds to
  {HKCU,HKLM}SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client 
  
* The <cell name> registry values used to store the token expiration
  reminders have been moved from 
  HKLM\Software\TransarcCorporation\AFS Client\AfsCreds to
  {HKCU,HKLM}SOFTWARE\OpenAFS\Client\Reminders
 
* Obtain the Logon User Name from the Explorer key when available

* new text document doc\txt\winnotes\registry.txt lists all registry
  values used by OpenAFS (excluding the AFS Server)

* BUG: rx_securityClass objects were not properly reference 
  counted and were never freed.  

* BUG: reduce the number of conditions under which CM_ERROR_TIMEOUT
  would be generated.  The existence of a server does not imply
  that it is not down.  If all of the servers for a cell are down
  return CM_ERROR_NOSUCHVOLUME instead.  This prevents the Explorer
  Shell from hanging.

* BUG: the directory name lookup cache failed to free the entries
  in the cache when the name cache entries cycled.  The entries
  in the cache would become dereferenced without being freed.

* BUG: fs setserverprefs could be executed without Administrator
  privileges

* BUG: the number of allocated NCB objects (100) exceeded the number
  which could actually be waited upon by the kernel (64).  Any objects
  which were utilized above the limit could never have event completions
  detected.

* BUG: smb_username_t objects were not being reference counted and 
  were not properly freed.

* BUG: smb_tid_t objects could under unusual circumstances be freed
  before they were no longer referenced.

* BUG: smb_fid_t object pointer were frequently used even when 
  their value could be NULL.   They were not properly released and
  therefore they were never freed.

* BUG: smb_packet_t data structures were not completely initialized
  upon creation

* BUG: when Rx produces a CM_ERROR_NOIPC error do not return "Access
  Denied" because that causes the Explorer Shell to try again until
  access is obtained.  Instead return "Remote Resources" which allows 
  the shell to move on and treat the error as transient.

* BUG: when initializing the NCBreturns structure, separate Event objects
  were created for each NCB although a single Event object was supposed
  to be shared by all.

* BUG: smb_dirSearch_t objects were not being properly referenced counted
  or freed.

* BUG: smb_tran2Packet_t objects were not being properly referenced 
  counted or freed.

* BUG: directory path creation did not handle the case of multiple
  directories requiring creation in one attempt

* BUG: SMB requests which required an Extended Response were ignored.
  This prevented some files from being written to AFS volumes.

* BUG: character strings were being freed even after they were 
  inserted into in use data structures

* BUG: inconsistent usernames were used when High Security mode was
  enabled.  (there is still much to do in this area)

* BUG: pioctl() calls which require out of band RPC operations were
  susceptible to race conditions when performed by multiple processes

* BUG: memory allocation and deallocation crossed instances of the
  C Runtime Library producing memory leakage and corruption in 
  afscreds and the client configurator.
