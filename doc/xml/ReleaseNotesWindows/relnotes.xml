    <title id="Preface">Preface</title>
    <para>The Andrew File System (AFS) is a globally-accessible location-independent file system
      that uses local caching to increase its performance. An AFS client accesses files anonymously
      or authenticated via Kerberos. The global AFS is partitioned into cells. Each AFS cell is a
      collection of AFS volumes that are administered by a common entity. AFS cells can be
      administered by a department even when the associated Kerberos authentication realms are
      managed by a much larger organization. AFS clients and servers take advantage of Kerberos
      cross-realm authentication to permit authenticated access by entities located outside the
      local realm. Authorization is enforced by the use of directory level access control lists of
      individual or group identities. </para>
    <para>The AFS volume is a tree of files and sub-directories. AFS volumes are created by administrators and are joined to an AFS cell via the use of a mount point. Once a volume is created, users can create files and directories as well as mount points and symlinks within the volume without regard for the physical location of the volume. Administrators can move the volume to another server as necessary without the need to notify users. In fact, the volume move can occur while files in the volume are in use. </para>
    <para>AFS volumes can be replicated to read-only copies. When accessing files from a read-only replica, clients will read all of the data from a single replica. If that replica becomes unavailable, the clients will failover to any replica that is reachable. Users of the data are unaware of where the replicas are stored or which one is being accessed. The contents of the replicas can be updated at any time by
      <emphasis>releasing</emphasis> the current contents of the source volume.
    </para>
    <para>OpenAFS for Windows (OAFW) provides AFS client access on Microsoft Windows operating
      systems. It strives to maintain transparency such that the user is unaware of the distinction
      between the use of AFS and Microsoft Windows file shares. OAFW can be part of a single sign-on
      solution by allowing credentials for a Kerberos principal to be obtained at logon and for that
      principal to be used to obtain AFS tokens for one or more cells. OAFW is implemented as a
      native installable file system and maintains the portability of file paths by its use of the
      \\AFS UNC server name.</para>
    <para>OpenAFS is the product of an open source development effort begun on 1 November 2000.
      OpenAFS is maintained and developed by a group of volunteers with the support of the end user
      community. When OpenAFS is used as part of your computing infrastructure, please <link

      <para>Starting with the 1.5.50 release of OpenAFS for Windows, each of the AFS Client Service, the AFS Explorer Shell Extension, and the command-line tools are Unicode enabled.  No longer is OpenAFS restricted to accessing file system objects whose names can be represented in the locale specific OEM code page.  This has significant benefits for end users.  Most importantly it permits non-Western languages to now be used for file system object names in AFS from Microsoft Windows operating systems.  Now that Unicode names are supported,
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming_user_profile">Roaming User Profiles</ulink> and
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folder_redirection">Folder Redirection</ulink> will no longer fail when a user attempts to store an object with a name that cannot be represented in the OEM code page.
      </para>
      <para>Unicode names are stored in AFS using UTF-8 encoding.  UTF-8 is supported as a locale on MacOS X, Linux, Solaris, and most other operating systems.  This permits non-Western object names to be exchanged between Microsoft Windows and other operating systems.  The OpenAFS for Windows client also implements
        <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_normalization">Unicode Normalization</ulink> as part of the name lookup algorithm.  This is necessary because Unicode does not provide a unique representation for each input string.  The use of normalization permits a file system object name created on MacOS X to be matched with the same string entered on Microsoft Windows even though the operating system's choice of representation may be different.
      </para>
      <para>It is important to note that AFS file servers are character-set agnostic.  All file system object names are stored as octet strings without any character set tagging.  If a file system object is created using OEM Code Page 858 and then interpreted as UTF-8 it is likely that the object name will appear to be gibberish.  OpenAFS for Windows goes to great lengths to ensure that the object name is converted to a form that will permit the user to rename the object using Unicode.  Accessing UTF-8 names on UNIX systems that have the locale set to one of the ISO Latin character sets will result in the UTF-8 strings appearing to be gibberish.  </para>
      <para>UNIX AFS can not perform Unicode Normalization for string comparisons.  Although it is possible to store and read Unicode object names, it is possible that a user may not be able to open an object by typing the name of the object at the keyboard.  GUI point and click operations should permit any object to be accessed.</para>

        <para>MacOS X uses UTF-8 Normalization Form D (NFD) whereas Microsoft Windows and most other
          applications use UTF-8 Normalization Form C (NFC).  The difference is that in NFD Unicode
          character sequences containing diacritical marks are decomposed whereas in NFC the Unicode
          character sequences use combined characters whenever possible.  Whereas Microsoft Windows
          can display and manipulate files stored using NFD, MacOS X Finder does have trouble with
          filenames that are NFC encoded.  All file names stored by the OpenAFS Windows client use
          NFC.</para>

        integrated logon, the AFS Authentication Tool, the Network Identity Manager AFS provider,
        and the aklog command. These tools provide support for Kerberos v5 authentication including

      <para>With Heimdal or Kerberos for Windows installed, the OpenAFS for Windows client can
        perform authentication to AFS services using Kerberos v5 service tickets as AFS tokens. When
        a Kerberos v5 derived AFS token is used, all of the AFS Volume Location and File Servers
        within the authenticated cell must support Kerberos v5. If a Kerberos v5 based token is
        presented to an AFS server that does not support them, the server will be unable to respond
        to the client. Attempts to access AFS volumes stored on such a server will fail with the
        Windows STATUS_NO_KERB_KEY (0xC0000322L) error. Kerberos v5 based tokens are supported by
        OpenAFS revisions 1.2.8 or later. IBM AFS 3.6 servers do not support Kerberos v5.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para> There are two things to consider when using an Active Directory as the Kerberos
                realm that issues the AFS service ticket. First, the Kerberos v5 tickets issued by
                Active Directory can be quite large when compared to tickets issued by traditional
                UNIX KDCs due to the inclusion of Windows specific authorization data <ulink
                  url="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc237917%28v=prot.10%29.aspx">(the
                  Microsoft PAC)</ulink>. If the issued tickets are larger than 344 bytes, OpenAFS
                1.2.x servers will be unable to process them and will issue a RXKADBADTICKET error.
                OpenAFS 1.4 (and beyond) servers can support the largest tickets that Active
                Directory can issue. </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Second, the Kerberos v5 tickets issued by Windows 2003 Active Directory are
                encrypted with the DES-CBC-MD5 encryption type (enctype). OpenAFS 1.2.x servers only
                support the DES-CBC-CRC enctype. As a result, OpenAFS 1.2.x servers cannot process
                the resulting Kerberos v5 tokens. Windows 2000 Active Directory issues tickets with
                the DES-CBC-CRC enctype. Windows Server 2008 R2 Active Directory domain by default
                disables use of DES-CBC-MD5 and it must be enabled. </para>

                  >Knowledge Base article 832572</ulink> a new NO_AUTH_REQUIRED flag that can be set
                on the account mapped to the AFS service principal. When this flag is set, the PAC
                authorization data will not be included in the ticket. Setting this flag is
                recommended for all accounts that are associated with non-Windows services and that
                do not understand the authorization data stored in the PAC. This flag cannot be used
                if AFS service tickets are obtained via cross-realm using an Active Directory user
                principal. </para>

        <para>Before there was native support for Kerberos v5 derived AFS tokens, the krb524 service was used to convert a Kerberos v5 service ticket into a Kerberos v4 service ticket that could in turn be used to construct an AFS authentication token. As of OpenAFS 1.2.8 [14 December 2002], support was added to allow the immediate use of Kerberos v5 tickets as AFS (2b) tokens. This is the first building block necessary to break away from the limitations of Kerberos v4 with AFS. By using Kerberos v5 directly the security holes inherent in Kerberos v4 cross-realm are avoided.  Use of cryptographically stronger algorithms for authentication and encryption become a possibility.</para>
        <para>Another reason for using Kerberos v5 directly is because the krb524 service runs on port (4444/udp), which has increasingly been blocked by Internet service providers. The port was used to spread a worm which attacked Microsoft Windows in the Summer of 2003. When the port is blocked users find that they are unable to authenticate.</para>
        <para>Replacing the Kerberos v4 ticket with a Kerberos v5 ticket is a win in all situations except when the cell name does not match the realm name and the principal names placed into the ACL's are not the principal names from the Kerberos v5 ticket.  Unfortunately, some organizations have AFS cell names and Kerberos realm names which differ by more then just typographic case and rely the krb524d service to map the Kerberos v5 client principal name from realm FOO to a Kerberos v4 principal in realm BAR. This allows user@FOO to appear to be user@bar for the purposes of accessing the AFS cell.
        </para>
        <para>To support this mode of operation OpenAFS for Windows versions 1.4.x through 1.6.x supported a registry value,

Previous revisions of this documentation advised that this option should only be used by individuals until such time as their organizations transitioned away from the krb524 service.
        </para>
        <para>Over the last few years all Kerberos distributions have removed support for Kerberos v4.  As a result, OpenAFS can no longer support the krb524d service and the functionality has been removed from the source tree for the 1.7.x release.</para>
        <para>As an alternative, sites should be aware that the OpenAFS 1.4.x servers permit the use of a secondary realm name that can be treated as equivalent to the cell name for authentication.  This functionality can be used to avoid the need for the krb524 service if and only if both realms are managed by the same administrative entity.

          Server 2008 R2, Heimdal and MIT have disabled the use of weak encryption types in their

          the weak encryption types including DES-CBC-CRC and DES-CBC-MD5 must be enabled.  In

      <para> This section is preserved for those sites that may want to manually configure the
        OpenAFS Client Service to run as an SMB Gateway to AFS instead of using the native IFS file
        system redirector driver. When the IFS driver is active, the Microsoft Loopback Adapter is
        ignored. The OpenAFS 1.7.x installer will not install a Microsoft Loopback Adapter by
        default nor will it remove one if already present on the machine. </para>
      <para>The Microsoft Loopback Adapter (MLA) is installed with a name "AFS" and a pre-assigned IP address of 10.254.254.253. The MLA is bound to the "Client for Microsoft Networks" service and not bound to the "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" service. If the MLA is unbound to "Client Microsoft Networks", the OpenAFS Client Service will become inaccessible when the machine is disconnected from the network. If the MLA is bound to "File and Printer Sharing ..." there will be a service type collision between the "AFS" SMB Service and the local machine's File Sharing Service.  This will result in the OpenAFS client service becoming inaccessible and the "NET VIEW \\AFS" command will return a "System Error 52" message. To correct the problem:</para>

      <para>When the MLA is not installed the NETBIOS name published by the OpenAFS SMB server must be unique in order to avoid name conflicts on public network.  The unique name will take the form "<emphasis>MACHINE</emphasis>-AFS". One of the benefits of using the MLA is that the NETBIOS name does not have to be published on any adapter other than the MLA. Therefore the chosen name is no longer required to be globally unique. Instead the NETBIOS name associated with the AFS Client Service is simply "AFS" and portable UNC paths of the form \\AFS\cellname\path can now be used on all machines.

      <para>Historically, when the OpenAFS Client Service starts it must mount the "root.afs" volume
        of the default cell. The "root.afs" volume contains the set of mount points to the
        "root.cell" volumes of various cells the administrator of the default cell believes should
        be accessible. If the "root.afs" volume is inaccessible when the client service starts, the
        service will terminate unexpectedly. Since many users now use laptops or otherwise operate
        in disconnected environments in which a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection may be
        required to access the cell's servers, it is often the case that the "root.afs" volume is
        unreachable and the OpenAFS Client Service can not successfully start. </para>
      <para>Freelance mode dynamically constructs a fake "root.afs" volume from mount points and
        symlinks stored in the local registry.  This permits the OpenAFS Client Service to operate
        in these environments.</para>
      <para>The content of the fake "root.afs" volume is dynamically generated as cells are accessed. When the fake "root.afs" volume is initially constructed it will only contain two mount points: a

      <para>OpenAFS for Windows installs a WinLogon Authentication Provider to provide Single
        Sign-On functionality (aka Integrated Logon.) Integrated Logon can be used to obtain AFS
        tokens when the Windows username and password match the username and password associated
        with the default cell's Kerberos realm. For example, if the Windows username is "jaltman"
        and the default cell is "your-file-system.com", then Integrated Logon can be successfully
        used if the windows password matches the password assigned to the Kerberos principal
        "jaltman@YOUR-FILE-SYSTEM.COM". The realm "YOUR-FILE-SYSTEM.COM" is obtained by performing a
        domain name to realm mapping on the hostname of one of the cell's Volume Database
        servers.</para>
      <para>Integrated Logon is required if roaming user profiles are stored within the AFS file
        system. OpenAFS does not provide tools for synchronizing the Windows and Kerberos user
        accounts and passwords.  Integrated Logon can be enabled or disabled via the <link
          linkend="Value_LogonOptions">LogonOptions</link> registry value.</para>
      <para>When Heimdal or KFW is installed, Integrated Logon will use it to obtain tokens using
        Kerberos v5. If you must use the <emphasis role="italic">deprecated</emphasis> kaserver for
        authentication instead of Kerberos v5, the use of KFW can be disabled via the <link
          linkend="Value_EnableKFW">EnableKFW</link> registry value. </para>
      <para>Integrated Logon will not transfer Kerberos v5 tickets into the user's logon session credential cache.  This is no longer possible on Vista and Windows 7.</para>
      <para>Integrated Logon does not have the ability to cache the username and password for the
        purpose of obtaining tokens if the Kerberos KDC is inaccessible at logon time.</para>

      <para>OpenAFS authenticates SMB connections using either NTLM or GSS SPNEGO (NTLM). In previous versions of OpenAFS, the SMB connections were unauthenticated which opened the door for several attacks which could be used to obtain access to another user's tokens on shared machines. </para>
      <para>When GSS SPNEGO attempts a Kerberos v5 authentication, the Windows SMB client will attempt to retrieve service tickets for "cifs/afs@REALM" (if the loopback adapter is in use) or "cifs/machine-afs@REALM" (if the loopback adapter is not being used). It is extremely important that this service principal not exist in the KDC database as the Kerberos authentication must fail allowing automatic fallback to NTLM. When NTLM is used a special local authentication mode will be used that does not require access to the user's password. Instead, Windows will internally recognize the request as coming from a local logon session.</para>
      <para>It should also be noted that because Kerberos v5 authentication cannot be used, it is not possible to digitally sign the SMB communications.   On systems that require Digital Signing of SMB Client connections, access to \\AFS will fail with a connection error.</para>

      <para>Many applications on Windows (e.g. Microsoft Office) require the use of byte range locks applied to a file either to protect against simultaneous file access or as a signaling mechanism. OpenAFS for Windows release 1.5 (or greater) implements byte range locking within the CIFS-AFS gateway server. This support for byte range locking obtains AFS' advisory file server locks to simulate Microsoft Windows mandatory locks. When an application opens a file, a lock will be obtained from AFS indicating that the file is in use. If the lock is a write lock, access to the file will be restricted to other applications running on the same machine as the first application to request the lock. Applications running on other machines will see the AFS full file lock and will be unable to access the file.</para>
      <para>Most Windows applications and Windows itself opens files in shared read mode. When this is done, a read lock is applied to the file. This does not prevent shared read access across multiple machines but is used to ensure that no one writes to the file while it is in use.</para>
      <para>As the CIFS-AFS gateway server attempts to implement Windows lock semantics on top of AFS lock semantics it is important to understand how AFS file locks work. In Windows there are no special privileges associated with obtaining file locks. If you can read or execute a file, then you can obtain shared and exclusive locks. In general, a Windows shared lock equates to an AFS read lock and a Windows exclusive lock equates to an AFS write lock. In AFS if you can write to a file, then you can obtain a write lock. However, in AFS if you can read a file it does not mean that you can obtain a read lock on it. The ability to obtain read locks is granted only if you have the lock (or ‘k') privilege. This behavior is required in order to allow anonymous users to read files while preventing them from being able to deny access to the files to other users.
        <emphasis>OpenAFS 1.4.0 and earlier as well as all IBM AFS file servers have an implementation bug that prevents users with write privileges from being able to obtain locks without the lock privilege.</emphasis> When AFS serves data out of read-only volumes the file server will deny all requests for read and write locks because the contents of the volume cannot be changed by the client.
      </para>
      <para>Since Microsoft Windows applications almost always attempt to obtain a temporary exclusive lock when accessing files the OpenAFS Client's CIFS-AFS gateway implements the following semantics in order to reduce the inconvenience on end users. </para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para>If the file is located on a read-only volume and the application requests a shared lock, the CIFS-AFS server will grant the lock request without asking the AFS file server.</para>

      <para>OpenAFS for Windows implements an SMB server which is used as a gateway to the AFS filesystem. Because of limitations of the SMB implementation in pre-1.5.50 releases, Windows stored all files into AFS using OEM code pages such as CP437 (United States) or CP850 (Western Europe). These code pages are incompatible with the ISO Latin-1 or Unicode (UTF-8) character sets typically used as the default on UNIX systems in both the United States and Western Europe. Filenames stored by OpenAFS for Windows were therefore unreadable on UNIX systems if they include any of the following characters:</para>

      <para>There is a known issue with storing Windows Roaming Profiles when the profile contains either directories or files with names which cannot be represented in the local OEM character set.

      <para>The performance of the AFS Client Service is significantly affected by the access times associated with the AFSCache paging file. When given the choice, the AFSCache file should be placed on a fast disk, preferably formatted NTFS and using a Solid State Disk, the file should not be compressed and should consist of as few fragments as possible. Significant performance gains can be achieved by defragmenting the AFSCache file with SysInternal's Contig utility while the AFS Client Service is stopped.</para>

      <para>The OpenAFS Client reports timestamps on files stored in AFS in UTC all year round. In locales with daylight savings time, previous versions of AFS for Windows reported the time when DST is active as UTC+1. This was done to preserve the relative local time for the user. A file stored at 11:00am EST in January would be reported as having been stored at 11:00am EDT in June. Unfortunately, this has the negative side effect of changing the reported timestamp from 16:00UTC to 15:00UTC. Since Windows treats all file times in UTC, data synchronization applications which rely on the timestamp would believe that all files stored in AFS had changed.</para>
      <para>It should be noted that UNIX based operating systems (such as Solaris) do not appear to report file times to applications in UTC. They do preserve the relative local time. This may confuse some users who are used to being able to compare the timestamp in an UNIX shell with the timestamp from the Windows explorer. During DST, these two times will no longer agree even though they are in fact representing the same moment in time.</para>

      <para>The OpenAFS Client implements Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs). They are used to provide the AFS file server with a method of identifying the client that is independent of IP address. This permits the AFS file server to track mobile clients or those behind Network Address Translators when they move from address to address or port to port. Tracking the client improves client performance by permitting callback state to be maintained across location changes. The UUID is generated when the AFSCache file is created and is maintained as long as the contents of the AFSCache file are valid. The UUID is stored in the AFSCache file.</para>
      <para>When cloning machines that have Windows AFS client installed it is necessary to generate a new UUID for each client. This will be done automatically if the Windows Machine SID is re-generated using Microsoft SysPrep. If the SID is not being re-generated either the AFSCache file should be deleted or the command
        <emphasis>fs uuid -generate</emphasis> must be executed after the the clone is created.

      <para><emphasis>This section does not apply unless the OpenAFS Service is manually configured as an SMB Gateway.</emphasis></para>
      <para>Microsoft Office makes heavy use of asynchronous input/output methods for reading and writing to file streams. This can result in hundreds of requests being simultaneously queued for service by the CIFS client with a fixed timeout period. As the AFS CIFS server is local to the machine the Windows CIFS client believes that it can respond almost instantaneously to write requests as the actual writing to the AFS file server is performed by a background daemon thread. When the actual network bandwidth to the AFS file server is slow and the file size is large it is possible for the CIFS client to time out the connection. When this happens a "delayed write error" will be reported to the user and the application may crash. The only workaround at the current time is to save first to a local disk and subsequently copy the file to AFS as copying a file with the explorer shell does not use asynchronous i/o. </para>
      <para>The CIFS session timeout defaults to 45 seconds and can be increased by modifying the
        <link linkend="Value_ConnDeadTimeout">ConnDeadTimeout registry value</link>.
      </para>
      <para>Beginning with the 1.5.33 release, the performance characteristics of SMB Write Data operations can be adjusted.  In prior releases all writes were performed using a restricted asynchronous store model in which only one asynchronous store operation per file can be performed at a time.  The reason for this restriction is limit the amount of data the cache manager will accept without it having been written to the file server.  If too much unwritten data is accepted, the file close operation will block until all of the unwritten data is output and this could trigger a CIFS client disconnect.  </para>
      <para>Prior to 1.5.33 the size of the asynchronous store was always equal to the chunk size which was often too large for low bandwidth connections.  The asynchronous store size now defaults to 32KB and is configurable using the
        <link linkend="Value_SMBAsyncStoreSize">SMBAsyncStoreSize</link> registry value.  Asynchronous store operations can also be disabled using the
        <link linkend="Value_EnableSMBAsyncStore">EnableSMBAsyncStore</link> registry value in which case all writes received by the cache manager block until the Rx StoreData operation completes.
      </para>
      <para>During the first quarter of 2009 Microsoft added new functionality to the SMB Redirector which permits an extended timeout period to be used
            for an enumerated list of Netbios server names.  This functionality was distributed in Service Pack 2 for Vista and 2008 and is incorporated
            into the RTM releases of Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2.  Updates to Windows XP (KB916204), XP64 (KB969289), and Server 2003 (KB969289) were
            made available as hot fixes.  When this support is available, the OpenAFS for Windows client 1.5.61 and above will raise the timeout period
            from 45 seconds to 10 minutes.</para>

      </para>
      <para>The article says that services mounting drive letters are no longer supported by Microsoft and may act unpredictably.
            The experience other users have had is that if the connection to the OpenAFS CIFS/SMB server is terminated by the
            Windows CIFS client, the drive mapping may not be re-established until the machine is rebooted.</para>
      <para>OpenAFS supports UNC paths and whenever possible applications should be modified to use UNC form
            \\AFS\&lt;cellname&gt;\&lt;path&gt; instead of drive letters.</para>
      <para>Another problem with service mounted drive letters is that the drives are reported as local disk devices
            and cannot be resolved as being mapped to the \\AFS name space.  As a result, AFS path ioctl operations will
            fail.  The fs.exe and symlink.exe command line tools and the AFS Explorer Shell extension will not operate
            on service mounted drive letters.</para>

      <para>Although 64-bit Windows platforms support both 64-bit and 32-bit applications, the OpenAFS Service installed on the machine must be 64-bit. The 64-bit installer contains only 64-bit executables. In order to support 32-bit applications it is required that a separate 32-bit OpenAFS Tools set be installed.  This is especially true when the IFS redirector is in use as the 32-bit Network Provider DLL must be installed in order for 32-bit applications to access drive letters mapped to \\AFS.</para>
      <para>OpenAFS on 64-bit Windows benefits from the lifting of the 2GB process memory restriction that is present in 32-bit Windows. Without this restriction the AFS Cache File can become arbitrarily large limited only by available disk space.</para>

With UAC, applications only run with the minimum required privileges.  Even Administrator accounts run applications without the "Administrator" access control credentials.  One side effect of this is that existing applications that mix user and system configuration capabilities must be re-written to separate those functions that require "Administrator" privileges into a separate process space.  Future updates to OpenAFS will incorporate the necessary privilege separation, until that time some functions such as the Start and Stop Service features of the AFS Authentication Tool and the AFS Control Panel will not work unless they are "Run as Administrator".  When a Vista user account that is a member of the "Administrators" group is used to access the AFS Control Panel (afs_config.exe), the process must be "Run as Administrator".   Otherwise, attempts to modify the OpenAFS configuration will appear to succeed but in reality will have failed due to Vista's system file and registry virtualization feature.

            When performing an upgrade from earlier versions of Microsoft Windows the Microsoft Loopback Adapter (MSLA) will be uninstalled.
            OpenAFS should be re-installed after the Windows Upgrade installation to restore the MSLA configuration.</para>
      <para>Due to a feature change in Windows Vista's Plug-n-Play network stack, during a standby/hibernate operation the
            MSLA is disabled just as any other hardware device would be.  This causes the OpenAFS Client's network binding to be lost.
            As a result, it takes anywhere from 30 to 90 seconds after the operating system is resumed for access to the OpenAFS Client
            and the AFS file name space to be restored.  Until the network bindings have been re-established, ticket managers and other
            tools will report that the "AFS Client Service may not have been started".</para>

        The OpenAFS for Windows version of "fs newcell" prior to 1.5.74 behaved quite differently than its UNIX counterpart.
        Instead of adding cell server information for a new cell, the command simply caused the cache manager to destroy all of its
        cell server information and then reload it the next time the server list for a cell is needed.  The UNIX version explicitly
        replaces the server list for a cell with a new list.
      </para>
      <para>
        Beginning with the 1.5.75 release, the Windows version will continue to behave as prior versions did when no parameters
        are specified but will accept an extended UNIX command-line syntax as well.  In addition to the UNIX parameters,
        the Windows "fs newcell" command accepts four new ones:

		The IFS redirector driver represents all AFS mount points and AFS symlinks as reparse points within the file system name space
		using a Microsoft assigned tag value. Tools that are OpenAFS reparse point aware can create, query
 	 	and remove AFS symlinks and mount points without requiring knowledge
 		of AFS pioctls.  The explorer shell will be able to delete a mount

      <para>
 	 	When the OpenAFS Service is configured as an SMB Gateway, all AFS Tokens are associated with Windows user names.
		With the IFS redirector driver, tokens are associated with Authentication Groups.
 		By default, an authentication group is allocated for each User SID
		and Logon Session Id combination.  In addition, it is possible for
		processes to create additional Authentication Groups.  Each thread in
		a process can select an Authentication Group within the process as the
		active Authentication Group.
		</para>
 	  <para>
		One of the significant benefits of Authentication Groups within the
		Windows environment is that Windows services (svchost.exe, csrss.exe,
		etc.) which impersonate user processes will seamlessly gain access
		to the user's AFS credentials for the lifetime of the impersonation.

      In Windows 8 and Server 2012 Microsoft has introduced a new file system, ReFS, and has begun the process of transitioning away from several legacy file system properties including 8.3 compatible short names for all file system objects.
      The OpenAFS file system has followed suit and is disabling automatic generation of 8.3 compatible names on Windows 8 and Server 2012.

      <para>To assist in debugging these problems, the registry value:</para>

With this key set the pioctl library will generate debugging output to stderr. The output will contain the Win32 API calls executed along with their most important parameters and their return code.

      <para>Every time the AFS Client Service starts it appends data about its progress and configuration to a file. This file provides information crucial to determining why the service cannot start when there are problems. When the process terminates due to a panic condition it will write to this file the source code file and line number of the error. In many cases the panic condition is due to a misconfiguration of the machine. In other cases it might be due to a programming error in the software. A quick review of the location in the source code will quickly reveal the reason for the termination.</para>

      <para id="Introduction_to_MSI_Deployment">A MSI installer option is available for those who wish to use Windows Installer for installing OpenAFS and for organizations that wish to deploy OpenAFS through Group Policy. The first version of OpenAFS for Windows available as an MSI was 1.3.65.</para>
      <para>This document provides a guide for authoring transforms used to customize the MSI package for a particular organization. Although many settings can be deployed via transforms, in an Active Directory environment it is advisable to deploy registry settings and configuration files through group policy and/or startup scripts so that machines where OpenAFS for Windows is already installed will pick up these customizations.</para>
      <section>
        <title id="MSI_Deployment_Requirements">7.1.1 Requirements</title>
        <para>The information in this document applies to MSI packages distributed with OpenAFS for Windows releases from 1.3.65 and onwards or MSI packages built from corresponding source releases. Not all releases support all the configuration options documented here.</para>
        <para>Authoring a "Windows Installer" transform requires additional software for editing the MSI database tables and generating the transform from the modified MSI package. ORCA.EXE and MSITRAN.EXE which are included in the Windows Platform SDK ("Windows Installer" SDK) can be used for this purpose.</para>
        <para>For reference, the schema for the MSI package is based on SCHEMA.MSI distributed with the Platform SDK.</para>

        <title id="MSI_Authoring_Transforms">7.1.2 Authoring a Transform</title>
        <para>Transforms describe a set of modifications to be performed on an existing MSI for the purpose of customizing it. This is ordinarily done by making a copy of the MSI to be customized, modifying the copy and then using the old and the new MSI to generate a transform. For example:</para>
        <orderedlist inheritnum="ignore" continuation="restarts">
          <listitem>
            <para>copy openafs.msi openafs-modified.msi</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>(edit the openafs-modified.msi to include the necessary changes)</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>msitran -g openafs.msi openafs-modified.msi openafs-transform.mst</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>(generates openafs-transform.mst, which is the transform)</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>Transforms have an extension of .mst. 'msitran' is a tool distributed as part of the "Windows Installer" SDK (part of the Windows Platform SDK).</para>
        <para>You can test a transform by:</para>
        <orderedlist inheritnum="ignore" continuation="restarts">
          <listitem>
            <para>copy openafs.msi openafs-test.msi</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>msitran -a openafs-transform.mst openafs-test.msi</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>and then checking the resulting openafs-test.msi to see if all changes you have made above to openafs-modified.msi is present in openafs-test.msi. 'msitran' will complain if some modification in the transform can not be successfully applied.</para>
        <para>As mentioned above, you can use a tool like ORCA.EXE to edit the MSI databases directly when editing openafs-modified.msi. More details are given below.</para>

      <title id="MSI_Configuration_Options">7.2. Configuration Options</title>
      <para>The logic necessary to implement many of the settings described in
        <link linkend="appendix_a">Appendix A</link> are present in the MSI. Most of these can be controlled by setting the corresponding properties to the desired value. Some settings may require modifying existing registry entries (though not recommended) or adding new resources (like files or registry keys). Instructions for performing these tasks are below.
      </para>
      <section>
        <title id="MSI_Configurable_Properties">7.2.1 Configurable Properties</title>
        <para>Most configurable properties correspond to registry keys or values. Due to the logic invoked based on the existence of these registry keys or values, they are only set if the associated property is defined to have a non null value. If the associated property is not defined in the MSI, the registry key or value will not be touched. By default, the MSI does not contain these properties and hence will not set the registry keys. You will need to add properties as needed to the MSI.</para>
        <para>When one of the configurable properties is set, the installer will use the property value to set the corresponding setting in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry hive. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive is not touched by the installer.</para>
        <para>For each property, the associated registry setting is referenced by the same text used in
          <link linkend="appendix_a">Appendix A</link>.
        </para>
        <para>Strings are quoted using single quotes (e.g. 'a string'). An empty string is denoted as ''. Note that you can't author null values into the 'Property' table.</para>

            <para>These properties are combined to add a command line option to the shortcut that will be created in the Start:Programs:OpenAFS and Start:Programs:Startup folders (see CREDSSTARTUP). The method of specifying the option was chosen for easy integration with the Windows Installer user interface. Although other methods can be used to specify options to AFSCREDS.EXE, it is advised that they be avoided as transforms including such options may not apply to future releases of OpenAFS.</para>

        <para>The OpenAFS configuration files (CellServDB) can be replaced by your own configuration files. These files are contained in separate MSI components so that you can disable them individually.</para>
        <para>The recommended method for replacing these files is to first disable the components containing the configuration files that you want to replace, and then add new components for the replacement files. This is outlined below (assuming you are using ORCA.EXE to author the transform).</para>
        <para>Note that transforms are not a good way to add a new file as an embedded stream. The method outlined here places the file in the same directory as the MSI for deployment.</para>

      <title id="Additional_Resources">7.3 Additional Resources</title>
      <para>If you want to add registry keys or files you need to create new components and features for those. Refer to the Windows Platform SDK for details.</para>
      <para>It is beyond the scope of this document to provide a comprehensive overview of how to add new resources through a transform. Please refer to the "Windows Installer" documentation for details. The relevant section is at :</para>
      <para>http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/msi/setup/using_transforms_to_add_resources.asp</para>
      <para>A sample walkthrough of adding a new configuration file is in section 2.3.</para>
      <para>Add new features under the 'feaClient' or 'feaServer' as appropriate and set the 'Level' column for those features to equal the 'Level' for their parent features for consistency. Note that none of the features in the OpenAFS for Windows MSI package are designed to be installed to run from 'source' or 'advertised'. It is recommended that you set 'msidbFeatureAttributesFavorLocal' (0), 'msidbFeatureAttributesFollowParent' (2) and 'msidbFeatureAttributesDisallowAdvertise' (8) attributes for new features.</para>
      <para>If you are creating new components, retain the same component GUID when creating new transforms against new releases of the OpenAFS MSI package.</para>
      <para>After making the adjustments to the MSI database using ORCA.EXE you can generate a transform with MSITRAN.EXE as follows :</para>
      <para>(Modified MSI package is 'openafs-en_US_new.msi' and the original MSI package is 'openafs-en_US.msi'. Generates transform 'openafs-transform.mst')</para>
      <para> &gt; msitran.exe -g openafs-en_US.msi openafs-en_US_new.msi openafs-transform.mst</para>
      <para>See the Platform SDK documentation for information on command line options for MSITRAN.EXE.</para>

      <title id="Upgrades">7.4. Upgrades</title>
      <para>The MSI package is designed to uninstall previous versions of OpenAFS for Windows during installation. Note that it doesn't directly upgrade an existing installation. This is intentional and ensures that development releases which do not have strictly increasing version numbers are properly upgraded.</para>
      <para>Versions of OpenAFS that are upgraded by the MSI package are:</para>

          <para>OpenAFS NSIS package</para>
          <para>All versions</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>Note that versions of the OpenAFS NSIS package prior to 1.3.65 had a bug where it couldn't be uninstalled properly in unattended mode. Therefore the MSI package will not try to uninstall an OpenAFS NSIS package if running unattended. This means that group policy based deployments will fail on machines that have the OpenAFS NSIS package installed.</para>
      <para>If you have used a different MSI package to install OpenAFS and wish to upgrade it you can author rows into the 'Upgrade' table as described in the Platform SDK.</para>
      <para>When performing an upgrade with msiexec.exe execute the MSI with the repair options "vomus".</para>

                     The NAT Ping Interval determines how frequently a low-level Rx ping packet is sent to
                     every file server using an anonymous connection.  The value 0 seconds disables the
                     functionality.  A non-zero value activates the NAT ping behavior.  This option can be
                     enabled on clients that access AFS file servers from behind a NAT or port mapping
                     firewall that maintains a short timeout on UDP port mappings.  In this case the AFS
                     cache manager may not receive AFS callbacks from the file server.  This registry value
                     should be set to a number of seconds shorter than the port mapping timeout period.
                     When there is no other information to go on, a value of 20 seconds can be used.

                  This functionality can be used for example to develop a test cell that is equivalent to a production cell with the exception that it substitutes test versions of volumes
                  for the production versions.  Another use is to assist in the transition from one cell name to another.</para>

        <para>The network provider can be configured to have different behavior depending on the
          domain that the user logs into. These settings are only relevant when using integrated
          login. A domain refers to an Active Directory (AD) domain, a trusted Kerberos (non-AD)
          realm or the local machine (i.e. local account logins). The domain name that is used for
          selecting the domain would be the domain that is passed into the NPLogonNotify function of
          the network provider.</para>

          <para>Kerberos v5 principal names are traditionally mapped to Kerberos v4 names by the AFS servers before they can be looked up in the Protection database.

To enable both names to be sent to the server by AFSCreds or Integrated Logon, set this value to 1.</para>
