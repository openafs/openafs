>To access the AFS filespace as an authenticated user, you must both log into an AFS client machine's local (UNIX) file
    system and authenticate with AFS. When you log in, you establish your local system identity. When you authenticate, you prove
    your identity to AFS and obtain a token, which your Cache Manager uses to prove your authenticated status to the AFS server
    processes it contacts on your behalf. Users who are not authenticated (who do not have a token) have limited access to AFS
    directories and files.</P

      an AFS-modified login utility, you log in and authenticate in separate steps. To determine which type of login utility your
      machine uses, you can check for AFS tokens after logging in, or ask your system administrator, who can also tell you about any
      differences between your login procedure and the two methods described here.</P

>While you are logged in and authenticated, you can access files in AFS just as you do in the UNIX file system. The only
    difference is that you can access potentially many more files. Just as in the UNIX file system, you can only access those files
    for which you have permission. AFS uses access control lists (ACLs) to control access, as described in <A

>AFS pathnames look very similar to UNIX file system names. The main difference is that every AFS pathname begins with
      the AFS root directory, which is called <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>/afs</B
></SPAN
> by convention. Having <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>/afs</B
></SPAN

CLASS="emphasis"

></SPAN
> ) rather than a forward slash ( <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>/</B
></SPAN
> ) to separate the
      elements in a pathname. Otherwise, your access to AFS filespace is much the same as for users working on UNIX machines.</P
><P
>The second element in AFS pathnames is generally a cell's name. For example, the ABC Corporation cell is called
      <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>abc.com</B
></SPAN
> and the pathname of every file in its filespace begins with the string <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>/afs/abc.com</B
></SPAN
>. Some cells also create a directory at the second level with a shortened name (such as
      <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>abc</B
></SPAN
> for <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>abc.com</B

CLASS="bold"

CLASS="emphasis"
>stateu</B
></SPAN
>
      for <SPAN
CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="emphasis"
>stateu.edu</B
></SPAN
>), to reduce the amount of typing necessary. Your system administrator can tell
      you if your cell's filespace includes shortened names like this. The rest of the pathname depends on how the cell's
      administrators organized its filespace.</P
