  <title>Appendix B. Configuring Legacy Components</title>
  
  <para>This chapter describes how to configure a number of deprecated 
  components in OpenAFS. Whilst these components are not recommended for sites
  performing new installations, it is recognised that there are a number of
  installations which have not yet transitioned from using these, for whom
  continued provision of installation instructions my be useful</para>

    <title>kaserver and Legacy Kerberos 4 Authentication</title>
    
    <para>This section contains instructions for installing server and client
    machines in sites which use either the deprecated AFS 
    <emphasis role="bold">kaserver</emphasis> or legacy Kerberos 4 
    authentication systems</para>
    
    <para>This should be used in conjuction with the installation instructures
    in earlier chapters, whose format it mirrors.</para>

      <title>Background</title>
      
      <para>As detailed in the OpenAFS "No more DES" roadmap, OpenAFS is moving
      away from the single DES based security models of both 
      <emphasis role="bold">kaserver</emphasis> and external Kerberos 4 KDCs, 
      in favour of using external, Kerberos 5 KDCs for authentication.</para>
      
      <para>AFS version 3 was designed and implemented during the late 80s and 
      early 90s when the state of the art in distributed computer 
      authentication and data security was Kerberos 4 and single DES. The 
      RXKAD security class was specified to use a single DES key and the kauth 
      authentication protocol is a derivative of MIT's Kerberos 4 protocol.
      </para>

      <para>For the better part of the last decade there has been concern 
      regarding the cryptographic strength of the DES cipher when used as a 
      building block within systems intended to prove authentication and/or 
      data integrity and privacy. Kerberos 4 and RXKAD are not extensible and 
      cannot negotiate non-DES key types. As a result efforts to migrate away 
      from Kerberos 4 based authentication at higher risk organizations have 
      been underway since the mid to late 90s. Ken Hornstein issued the first 
      of his Kerberos 5 migration kits for AFS in May 1999. </para>
      
      <para>In March 2003, the continued use of single DES and kauth as the 
      basis for OpenAFS security became a real-world threat when a significant 
      Kerberos 4 crossrealm vulnerability was published. The OpenAFS community 
      was notified in security advisory OPENAFS-SA-2003-001 which can be 
      found at http://www.openafs.org/security.</para>

      <para>As a result of the mounting concerns regarding the strength of 
      DES, NIST announced in May 2003 the withdrawal of FIPS 43-3 
      "Data Encryption Standard (DES)" as well as the associated FIPS 74 and 
      FIPS 81. In other words, NIST announced that DES and its derivatives 
      could no longer be used by the United States Government and should no 
      longer by those that trust its lead.</para>

      <para>In July 2003 MIT announced the end of life of the Kerberos 4 
      protocol which is distributed for backward compatibility as part of the 
      MIT Kerberos 5 distribution.</para>

        <para>At this point you incorporate AFS into the operating system's 
        Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) scheme. PAM integrates all 
        authentication mechanisms on the machine, including login, to provide 
        the security infrastructure for authenticated access to and from the 
        machine.</para>

        <para>Explaining PAM is beyond the scope of this document. It is 
        assumed that you understand the syntax and meanings of settings in the 
        PAM configuration file (for example, how the 
        <computeroutput>other</computeroutput> entry works, the effect of
        marking an entry as <computeroutput>required</computeroutput>, 
        <computeroutput>optional</computeroutput>, or
        <computeroutput>sufficient</computeroutput>, and so on).</para>

        <para>The following instructions explain how to alter the entries in 
        the PAM configuration file for each service for which you
        wish to use AFS authentication. Other configurations possibly also 
        work, but the instructions specify the recommended and
        tested configuration.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The instructions specify that you mark each entry as 
          <computeroutput>optional</computeroutput>. However, marking some
          modules as optional can mean that they grant access to the 
          corresponding service even when the user does not meet all of the
          module's requirements. In some operating system revisions, for 
          example, if you mark as optional the module that controls
          login via a dial-up connection, it allows users to login without 
          providing a password. See the <emphasis>OpenAFS Release
          Notes</emphasis> for a discussion of any limitations that apply to 
          this operating system.</para>

          <para>Also, with some operating system versions you must install 
          patches for PAM to interact correctly with certain
          authentication programs. For details, see the 
          <emphasis>OpenAFS Release Notes</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>At this point you incorporate AFS into the operating system's 
      Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) scheme. PAM
      integrates all authentication mechanisms on the machine, including 
      login, to provide the security infrastructure for
      authenticated access to and from the machine.</para>

      <para>Explaining PAM is beyond the scope of this document. It is 
      assumed that you understand the syntax and meanings of
      settings in the PAM configuration file (for example, how the 
      <computeroutput>other</computeroutput> entry works, the effect of
      marking an entry as <computeroutput>required</computeroutput>, 
      <computeroutput>optional</computeroutput>, or
      <computeroutput>sufficient</computeroutput>, and so on).</para>

      <para>The following instructions explain how to alter the entries in the 
      PAM configuration file for each service for which you
      wish to use AFS authentication. Other configurations possibly also 
      work, but the instructions specify the recommended and
      tested configuration.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The instructions specify that you mark each entry as 
        <computeroutput>optional</computeroutput>. However, marking some
        modules as optional can mean that they grant access to the 
        corresponding service even when the user does not meet all of the
        module's requirements. In some operating system revisions, 
        for example, if you mark as optional the module that controls
        login via a dial-up connection, it allows users to login without 
        providing a password. See the <emphasis>OpenAFS Release
        Notes</emphasis> for a discussion of any limitations that apply to 
        this operating system.</para>

        <para>Also, with some operating system versions you must install 
        patches for PAM to interact correctly with certain
        authentication programs. For details, see the 
        <emphasis>OpenAFS Release Notes</emphasis>.</para>
