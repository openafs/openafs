    <para>An encryption key is a string of octal numbers used to encrypt and decrypt packets of information. In AFS, a server
    encryption key is the key used to protect information being transferred between AFS server processes and between them and their
    clients. A server encryption key is essentially a password for a server process and like a user password is stored in the
    Authentication Database.</para>

    <para>Maintaining your cell's server encryption keys properly is the most basic way to protect the information in your AFS
    filespace from access by unauthorized users.</para>

      <para>Server encryption keys play a central role in the mutual authentication between client and server processes in AFS. For
      a more detailed description of mutual authentication, see <link linkend="HDRWQ75">A More Detailed Look at Mutual
      Authentication</link>.</para>

      <para>When a client wants to contact an AFS server, it first contacts the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) module of the
      Authentication Server. After verifying the client's identity (based indirectly on the password of the human user whom the
      client represents), the TGS gives the client a server ticket. This ticket is encrypted with the server's encryption key. (The
      TGS also invents a second encryption key, called the session key, to be used only for a single episode of communication
      between server and client. The server ticket and session key, together with other pieces of information, are collectively
      referred to as a token.)</para>

      <para>The client cannot read the server ticket or token because it does not know the server encryption key. However, the
      client sends it to the AFS server along with service requests, because the ticket proves to the AFS server processes that it
      has already authenticated with the TGS. AFS servers trust the TGS to grant tickets only to valid clients. The fact that the
      client possesses a ticket encrypted with the server's encryption key proves to the server that the client is valid. On the
      other hand, the client assumes that only a genuine AFS server knows the server encryption key needed to decrypt the ticket.
      The server's ability to decrypt the ticket and understand its contents proves to the client that the server is
      legitimate.</para>

            new key, it is likely that some clients still have valid, unexpired tokens sealed with the previous key. The more
            frequently you change the server encryption key, the more such tickets there are likely to be. To be able to grant
            service appropriately to clients with such tokens, an AFS server process must still be able to access the server
            encryption key used to seal it.</para>

            <para>You can safely delete an old server encryption key only when it is certain that no clients have tokens sealed with
            that key. In general, wait a period of time at least as long as the maximum token lifetime in your cell. By default, the
            maximum token lifetime for users is 25 hours (except for users whose Authentication Database entries were created by
            using the 3.0 version of AFS, for whom the default is 100 hours). You can use the <emphasis

            version of the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file. The easiest way to maintain consistency (if you run the
            United States edition of AFS) is to use the Update Server to distribute the contents of the system control machine's

            The data in the file is too sensitive for transfer in unencrypted form, and because of United States government exports

    <title>Displaying Server Encryption Keys</title>

    <para>To display the server encryption keys in the <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</emphasis> file on any file server
    machine, use the <emphasis role="bold">bos listkeys</emphasis> command. Use the <emphasis role="bold">kas examine</emphasis>

    </indexterm>

    <para>By default the commands do not display the actual string of octal digits that constitute a key, but rather a checksum, a
    decimal number derived by encrypting a constant with the key. This prevents unauthorized users from easily accessing the actual
    key, which they can then use to falsify or eavesdrop on protected communications. The <emphasis role="bold">bos
    listkeys</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">kas examine</emphasis> commands generate the same checksum for a given key, so
    displaying checksums rather than actual keys is generally sufficient. If you suspect that the keys differ in a way that the
    checksums are not revealing, then you are probably experiencing authentication problems throughout your cell. The easiest
    solution is to create a new server encryption key following the instructions in <link linkend="HDRWQ362">Adding Server
    Encryption Keys</link> or <link linkend="HDRWQ370">Handling Server Encryption Key Emergencies</link>. Another common reason to
    issue the <emphasis role="bold">bos listkeys</emphasis> command is to display the key version numbers currently in use, in
    preparation for choosing the next one; here, the checksum is sufficient because the key itself is irrelevant.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>In the file <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</emphasis> on the local disk of each server machine, for use
          by the AFS server processes running on the machine</para>
        </listitem>

          <para>In the <emphasis role="bold">afs</emphasis> entry in the Authentication Database, for use by the Ticket Granting
          Service (TGS) when creating tokens</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>

    <para>To ensure that server processes and the TGS share the same AFS server encryption key, execute all the steps in this
    section without interruption.</para>

    <para>The following instructions include a step in which you restart the database server processes (the Authentication, Backup,
    Protection, and Volume Location Server processes) on all database server machines. As a database server process starts, it reads
    in the server encryption key that has the highest key version number in the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file and
    uses it to protect the messages that it sends for synchronizing the database and maintaining quorum. It uses the same key
    throughout its lifetime, which can be for an extended period, even if you remove the key from the <emphasis
    role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file. However, if one of the peer database server processes restarts and the others do not,
    quorum and database synchronization break down because the processes are no longer using the same key: the restarted process is
    using the key that currently has the highest key version number, and the other processes are still using the key they read in
    when they originally started. To avoid this problem, it is safest to restart all of the database server processes when adding a
    new key.</para>

    <para>After adding a new key, you can remove obsolete keys from the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file to prevent it
    from becoming cluttered. However, you must take care not to remove keys that client or server processes are still using. For
    discussion and instructions, see <link linkend="HDRWQ368">Removing Server Encryption Keys</link>.</para>

    <para>You can periodically remove old keys from the <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</emphasis> file to keep it to a
    reasonable size. To avoid disturbing cell functioning, do not remove an old key until all tokens sealed with the key and held by
    users or client processes have expired. After adding a new key, wait to remove old keys at least as long as the longest token
    lifetime you use in your cell. For Authentication Database user entries created under AFS version 3.1 or higher, the default
    token lifetime is 25 hours; for entries created under AFS version 3.0, it is 100 hours.</para>

    <para>There is no command for removing the key from the <emphasis role="bold">afs</emphasis> entry in the Authentication
    Database, because the key field in that entry must never be empty. Use the <emphasis role="bold">kas setpassword</emphasis>

      <secondary>server encryption key emergency</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>In rare circumstances, the AFS server processes can become unable to decrypt the server tickets that clients or peer
    server processes are presenting. Activity in your cell can come to a halt, because the server processes believe that the tickets
    are forged or expired, and refuse to execute any actions. This can happen on one machine or several; the effect is more serious
    when more machines are involved.</para>

    <para>One common cause of server encryption key problems is that the client's ticket is encrypted with a key that the server
    process does not know. Usually this means that the <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</emphasis> on the server machine
    does not include the key in the <emphasis role="bold">afs</emphasis> Authentication Database entry, which the Authentication
    Server's Ticket Granting Service (TGS) module is using to encrypt server tickets.</para>

    <para>Another possibility is that the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> files on different machines do not contain the
    same keys. In this case, communications among server processes themselves become impossible. For instance, AFS's replicated
    database mechanism (Ubik) breaks down if the instances of a database server process on the different database server machines
    are not using the same key.</para>

    <para>The appearance of the following error message when you direct a <emphasis role="bold">bos</emphasis> command to a file
    server machine in the local cell is one possible symptom of server encryption key mismatch. (Note, however, that you can also
    get this message if you forget to include the <emphasis role="bold">-cell</emphasis> argument when directing the <emphasis
    role="bold">bos</emphasis> command to a file server machine in a foreign cell.)</para>

    <programlisting>
   bos: failed to contact host's bosserver (security object was passed a bad ticket).
</programlisting>

    <para>The solution to server encryption key emergencies is to put a new AFS server encryption key in both the Authentication
    Database and the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file on every server machine, so that the TGS and all server processes
    again share the same key.</para>

    <para>Handling key emergencies requires some unusual actions. The reasons for these actions are explained in the following
    sections; the actual procedures appear in the subsequent instructions.</para>

    <sect2 id="HDRWQ371">
      <title>Prevent Mutual Authentication</title>

      <para>It is necessary to prevent the server processes from trying to mutually authenticate with you as you deal with a key
      emergency, because they possibly cannot decrypt your token. When you do not mutually authenticate, the server processes assign
      you the identity <emphasis role="bold">anonymous</emphasis>. To prevent mutual authentication, use the <emphasis
      role="bold">unlog</emphasis> command to discard your tokens and include the <emphasis role="bold">-noauth</emphasis> flag on
      every command where it is available.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="Header_423">
      <title>Disable Authorization Checking by Hand</title>

      <para>Because the server processes recognize you as the user <emphasis role="bold">anonymous</emphasis> when you do not
      mutually authenticate, you must turn off authorization checking. Only with authorization checking disabled do the server
      processes allow the <emphasis role="bold">anonymous</emphasis> user to perform privileged actions such as key creation.</para>

      <para>In an emergency, disable authorization checking by creating the file <emphasis
      role="bold">/usr/afs/local/NoAuth</emphasis> by hand. In normal circumstances, use the <emphasis role="bold">bos
      setauth</emphasis> command instead.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="Header_424">
      <title>Work Quickly on Each Machine</title>

      <para>Disabling authorization checking is a serious security exposure, because server processes on the affected machine
      perform any action for anyone. Disable authorization checking only for as long as necessary, completing all steps in an
      uninterrupted session and as quickly as possible.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="Header_425">
      <title>Work at the Console</title>

      <para>Working at the console of each server machine on which you disable authorization checking ensures that no one else logs
      onto the console while you are working there. It does not prevent others from connecting to the machine remotely (using the
      <emphasis role="bold">telnet</emphasis> program, for example), which is why it is important to work quickly. The only way to
      ensure complete security is to disable network traffic, which is not a viable option in many environments. You can improve
      security in general by limiting the number of people who can connect remotely to your server machines at any time, as
      recommended in <link linkend="HDRWQ74">Improving Security in Your Cell</link>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="HDRWQ372">
      <title>Change Individual KeyFile Files</title>

      <para>If you use the Update Server to distribute the contents of the <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc</emphasis> directory,
      an emergency is the only time when it is appropriate to change the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file on individual
      machines instead. Updating each machine's file is necessary because mismatched keys can prevent the system control machine's
      <emphasis role="bold">upserver</emphasis> process from mutually authenticating with <emphasis
      role="bold">upclientetc</emphasis> processes on other server machines, in which case the <emphasis
      role="bold">upserver</emphasis> process refuses to distribute its <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file to
      them.</para>

      <para>Even if it appears that the Update Server is working correctly, the only way to verify that is to change the key on the
      system control machine and wait the standard delay period to see if the <emphasis role="bold">upclientetc</emphasis> processes
      retrieve the key. During an emergency, it does not usually make sense to wait the standard delay period. It is more efficient
      simply to update the file on each server machine separately. Also, even if the Update Server can distribute the file
      correctly, other processes can have trouble because of mismatched keys. The following instructions add the new key file on the
      system control machine first. If the Update Server is working, then it is distributing the same change as you are making on
      each server machine individually.</para>

      <para>If your cell does not use the Update Server, or uses the international edition of AFS, you always change keys on server
      machines individually. The following instructions are also appropriate for you.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="Header_427">
      <title>Two Component Procedures</title>

      <para>There are two subprocedures used frequently in the following instructions: disabling authorization checking and
      reenabling it. For the sake of clarity, the procedures are detailed here; the instructions refer to them as necessary.</para>
