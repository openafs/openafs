    <para>An encryption key is a string of octal numbers used to encrypt and decrypt packets of information. In AFS, a server
    encryption key is the key used to protect information being transferred between AFS server processes and between them and their
    clients. A server encryption key is essentially a password for a server process and like a user password is stored in the
    Authentication Database.</para>

    <para>Maintaining your cell's server encryption keys properly is the most basic way to protect the information in your AFS
    filespace from access by unauthorized users.</para>

      <para>Server encryption keys play a central role in the mutual authentication between client and server processes in AFS. For
      a more detailed description of mutual authentication, see <link linkend="HDRWQ75">A More Detailed Look at Mutual
      Authentication</link>.</para>

      <para>When a client wants to contact an AFS server, it first contacts the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) module of the
      Authentication Server. After verifying the client's identity (based indirectly on the password of the human user whom the
      client represents), the TGS gives the client a server ticket. This ticket is encrypted with the server's encryption key. (The
      TGS also invents a second encryption key, called the session key, to be used only for a single episode of communication
      between server and client. The server ticket and session key, together with other pieces of information, are collectively
      referred to as a token.)</para>

      <para>The client cannot read the server ticket or token because it does not know the server encryption key. However, the
      client sends it to the AFS server along with service requests, because the ticket proves to the AFS server processes that it
      has already authenticated with the TGS. AFS servers trust the TGS to grant tickets only to valid clients. The fact that the
      client possesses a ticket encrypted with the server's encryption key proves to the server that the client is valid. On the
      other hand, the client assumes that only a genuine AFS server knows the server encryption key needed to decrypt the ticket.
      The server's ability to decrypt the ticket and understand its contents proves to the client that the server is
      legitimate.</para>

            new key, it is likely that some clients still have valid, unexpired tokens sealed with the previous key. The more
            frequently you change the server encryption key, the more such tickets there are likely to be. To be able to grant
            service appropriately to clients with such tokens, an AFS server process must still be able to access the server
            encryption key used to seal it.</para>

            <para>You can safely delete an old server encryption key only when it is certain that no clients have tokens sealed with
            that key. In general, wait a period of time at least as long as the maximum token lifetime in your cell. By default, the
            maximum token lifetime for users is 25 hours (except for users whose Authentication Database entries were created by
            using the 3.0 version of AFS, for whom the default is 100 hours). You can use the <emphasis

    <title>Displaying Server Encryption Keys</title>

    <para>To display the server encryption keys in the <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</emphasis> file on any file server
    machine, use the <emphasis role="bold">bos listkeys</emphasis> command. Use the <emphasis role="bold">kas examine</emphasis>

      <secondary>checksum displayed</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>By default the commands do not display the actual string of octal digits that constitute a key, but rather a checksum, a
    decimal number derived by encrypting a constant with the key. This prevents unauthorized users from easily accessing the actual
    key, which they can then use to falsify or eavesdrop on protected communications. The <emphasis role="bold">bos
    listkeys</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">kas examine</emphasis> commands generate the same checksum for a given key, so
    displaying checksums rather than actual keys is generally sufficient. If you suspect that the keys differ in a way that the
    checksums are not revealing, then you are probably experiencing authentication problems throughout your cell. The easiest
    solution is to create a new server encryption key following the instructions in <link linkend="HDRWQ362">Adding Server
    Encryption Keys</link> or <link linkend="HDRWQ370">Handling Server Encryption Key Emergencies</link>. Another common reason to
    issue the <emphasis role="bold">bos listkeys</emphasis> command is to display the key version numbers currently in use, in
    preparation for choosing the next one; here, the checksum is sufficient because the key itself is irrelevant.</para>

    <para>If it is important to display the actual octal digits, include the <emphasis role="bold">-showkey</emphasis> argument to

          <para>In the file <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</emphasis> on the local disk of each server machine, for use
          by the AFS server processes running on the machine</para>

          <para>In the <emphasis role="bold">afs</emphasis> entry in the Authentication Database, for use by the Ticket Granting
          Service (TGS) when creating tokens</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>

    <para>To ensure that server processes and the TGS share the same AFS server encryption key, execute all the steps in this
    section without interruption.</para>

    <para>The following instructions include a step in which you restart the database server processes (the Authentication, Backup,
    Protection, and Volume Location Server processes) on all database server machines. As a database server process starts, it reads
    in the server encryption key that has the highest key version number in the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file and
    uses it to protect the messages that it sends for synchronizing the database and maintaining quorum. It uses the same key
    throughout its lifetime, which can be for an extended period, even if you remove the key from the <emphasis
    role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file. However, if one of the peer database server processes restarts and the others do not,
    quorum and database synchronization break down because the processes are no longer using the same key: the restarted process is
    using the key that currently has the highest key version number, and the other processes are still using the key they read in
    when they originally started. To avoid this problem, it is safest to restart all of the database server processes when adding a
    new key.</para>

    <para>After adding a new key, you can remove obsolete keys from the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file to prevent it
    from becoming cluttered. However, you must take care not to remove keys that client or server processes are still using. For
    discussion and instructions, see <link linkend="HDRWQ368">Removing Server Encryption Keys</link>.</para>

    <para>You can periodically remove old keys from the <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</emphasis> file to keep it to a
    reasonable size. To avoid disturbing cell functioning, do not remove an old key until all tokens sealed with the key and held by
    users or client processes have expired. After adding a new key, wait to remove old keys at least as long as the longest token
    lifetime you use in your cell. For Authentication Database user entries created under AFS version 3.1 or higher, the default
    token lifetime is 25 hours; for entries created under AFS version 3.0, it is 100 hours.</para>

    <para>There is no command for removing the key from the <emphasis role="bold">afs</emphasis> entry in the Authentication
    Database, because the key field in that entry must never be empty. Use the <emphasis role="bold">kas setpassword</emphasis>
    command to replace the <emphasis role="bold">afs</emphasis> key, but only as part of the complete procedure detailed in <link
    linkend="HDRWQ363">To add a new server encryption key</link>.</para>

    <para>Never remove from the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file the key that is currently in the <emphasis
    role="bold">afs</emphasis> entry in the Authentication Database. AFS server processes become unable to decrypt the tickets that
    clients present to them.</para>

    <para>In rare circumstances, the AFS server processes can become unable to decrypt the server tickets that clients or peer
    server processes are presenting. Activity in your cell can come to a halt, because the server processes believe that the tickets
    are forged or expired, and refuse to execute any actions. This can happen on one machine or several; the effect is more serious
    when more machines are involved.</para>

    <para>One common cause of server encryption key problems is that the client's ticket is encrypted with a key that the server
    process does not know. Usually this means that the <emphasis role="bold">/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</emphasis> on the server machine
    does not include the key in the <emphasis role="bold">afs</emphasis> Authentication Database entry, which the Authentication
    Server's Ticket Granting Service (TGS) module is using to encrypt server tickets.</para>

    <para>Another possibility is that the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> files on different machines do not contain the
    same keys. In this case, communications among server processes themselves become impossible. For instance, AFS's replicated
    database mechanism (Ubik) breaks down if the instances of a database server process on the different database server machines
    are not using the same key.</para>

    <para>The appearance of the following error message when you direct a <emphasis role="bold">bos</emphasis> command to a file
    server machine in the local cell is one possible symptom of server encryption key mismatch. (Note, however, that you can also
    get this message if you forget to include the <emphasis role="bold">-cell</emphasis> argument when directing the <emphasis
    role="bold">bos</emphasis> command to a file server machine in a foreign cell.)</para>

    <programlisting>
   bos: failed to contact host's bosserver (security object was passed a bad ticket).
</programlisting>

    <para>The solution to server encryption key emergencies is to put a new AFS server encryption key in both the Authentication
    Database and the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFile</emphasis> file on every server machine, so that the TGS and all server processes
    again share the same key.</para>

    <para>Installing a new server encryption key involves logging in to each
    server machine as root and confirming that the correct (i.e., new) key
    are in place in the <emphasis role="bold">KeyFileExt</emphasis> or
    <emphasis role="bold">rxkad.keytab</emphasis> (for OpenAFS 1.8.x
    releases).  The same keys must be installed on all servers in the cell,
    and when Kerberos is used for authentication, must match the key in the
    Kerberos database.</para>

    <para>While the keys are being installed, remote operations using
    regular authentication mechanisms, even with administrator credentials,
    may (continue to) fail.  Similarly, the ubik synchronization protocol
    among database servers may fail to synchronize due to the servers not
    being able to authenticate each other, making write operations to the
    database impossible.  In order to interact with individual server
    processes, the <emphasis role="bold">-localauth</emphasis> flag is used,
    allowing commands that are run on a system that has the cell's key (such
    as the server itself) to successfully authenticate as an administrator.
    Once the new keys are installed on all database servers and the
    90-second ubik recovery time has passed, the database servers should have
    elected a new coordinator, allowing write transactions to proceed
    again.</para>
