=head1 NAME

bos - Introduction to the bos command suite

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The commands in the B<bos> command suite are the administrative interface
to the Basic OverSeer (BOS) Server, which runs on every file server
machine to monitor the other server processes on it. If a process fails,
the BOS Server can restart it automatically, taking into account
interdependencies between it and other processes. The BOS Server frees
system administrators from constantly monitoring the status of server
machines and processes.

There are several categories of commands in the B<bos> command suite:

=over 4

=item *

Commands to administer server process binary files: B<bos getdate>, B<bos
install>, B<bos prune>, and B<bos uninstall>.

=item *

Commands to maintain system configuration files: B<bos addhost>, B<bos
addkey>, B<bos adduser>, B<bos listhosts>, B<bos listkeys>, B<bos
listusers>, B<bos removehost>, B<bos removekey>, B<bos removeuser>, and
B<bos setcellname>.

=item *

Commands to start and stop processes: B<bos create>, B<bos delete>, B<bos
restart>, B<bos shutdown>, B<bos start>, B<bos startup>, and B<bos stop>.

=item *

Commands to set and verify server process and server machine status: B<bos
getlog>, B<bos getrestart>, B<bos setauth>, B<bos setrestart>, and B<bos
status>.

=item *

A command to restore file system consistency: B<bos salvage>.

=item *

Commands to obtain help: B<bos apropos> and B<bos help>.

=back

The BOS Server and the B<bos> commands use and maintain the following
configuration and log files:

=over 4

=item *

The F</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB> file lists the local cell's database server
machines. These machines run the Authentication, Backup, Protection and
Volume Location (VL) Server processes, which maintain databases of
administrative information. The database server processes consult the file
to learn about their peers, whereas the other server processes consult it
to learn where to access database information as needed. To administer the
F<CellServDB> file, use the following commands: B<bos addhost>, B<bos
listhosts>, B<bos removehost>, and B<bos setcellname>.

=item *

The F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file lists the server encryption keys that the
server processes use to decrypt tickets presented by client processes and
one another. To administer the F<KeyFile> file, use the following
commands: B<bos addkey>, B<bos listkeys>, and B<bos removekey>.

=item *

The F</usr/afs/etc/ThisCell> file defines the cell to which the server
machine belongs for the purposes of server-to-server communication.
Administer it with the B<bos setcellname> command. There is also a
F</usr/vice/etc/ThisCell> file that defines the machine's cell membership
with respect to the AFS command suites and Cache Manager access to AFS
data.

=item *

The F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file lists the user name of each
administrator authorized to issue privileged B<bos> and B<vos>
commands. To administer the F<UserList> file, use the following commands:
B<bos adduser>, B<bos listusers>, and B<bos removeuser>.

=item *

The F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file defines which AFS server processes
run on the server machine, and whether the BOS Server restarts them
automatically if they fail. It also defines when all processes restart
automatically (by default once per week), and when the BOS Server restarts
processes that have new binary files (by default once per day). To
administer the F<BosConfig> file, use the following commands: B<bos
create>, B<bos delete>, B<bos getrestart>, B<bos setrestart>, B<bos
start>, and B<bos stop>.

=item *

The F</usr/afs/log/BosLog> file records important operations the BOS
Server performs and error conditions it encounters.

=back

For more details, see the reference page for each file.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following arguments and flags are available on many commands in the
B<bos> suite. The reference page for each command also lists them, but
they are described here in greater detail.

=over 4

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. It is acceptable to abbreviate
the cell name to the shortest form that distinguishes it from the other
entries in the F</usr/vice/etc/CellServDB> file on the local machine. If
the B<-cell> argument is omitted, the command interpreter determines the
name of the local cell by reading the following in order:

=over 4

=item *

The value of the AFSCELL environment variable.

=item *

The local F</usr/vice/etc/ThisCell> file.

=back

Do not combine the B<-cell> and B<-localauth> options. A command on which
the B<-localauth> flag is included always runs in the local cell (as
defined in the server machine's local F</usr/afs/etc/ThisCell> file),
whereas a command on which the B<-cell> argument is included runs in the
specified foreign cell.

=item B<-help>

Prints a command's online help message on the standard output stream. Do
not combine this flag with any of the command's other options; when it is
provided, the command interpreter ignores all other options, and only
prints the help message.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using the server encryption key with the
highest key version number in the local F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The
B<bos> command interpreter presents the ticket, which never expires, to
the BOS Server during mutual authentication.

Use this flag only when issuing a command on a server machine; client
machines do not usually have a F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file.  The issuer
of a command that includes this flag must be logged on to the server
machine as the local superuser C<root>. The flag is useful for commands
invoked by an unattended application program, such as a process controlled
by the UNIX B<cron> utility or by a cron entry in the machine's
F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig> file. It is also useful if an administrator is
unable to authenticate to AFS but is logged in as the local superuser
C<root>.

Do not combine the B<-cell> and B<-localauth> options. A command on which
the B<-localauth> flag is included always runs in the local cell (as
defined in the server machine's local F</usr/afs/etc/ThisCell> file),
whereas a command on which the B<-cell> argument is included runs in the
specified foreign cell. Also, do not combine the B<-localauth> and
B<-noauth> flags.

=item B<-noauth>

Establishes an unauthenticated connection to the BOS Server, in which the
BOS Server treats the issuer as the unprivileged user C<anonymous>. It is
useful only when authorization checking is disabled on the server machine
(during the installation of a file server machine or when the B<bos
setauth> command has been used during other unusual circumstances). In
normal circumstances, the BOS Server allows only privileged users to issue
commands that change the status of a server or configuration file, and
refuses to perform such an action even if the B<-noauth> flag is
provided. Do not combine the B<-noauth> and B<-localauth> flags.

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the AFS server machine on which to run the command.  Identify
the machine by its IP address in dotted decimal format, its
fully-qualified host name (for example, C<fs1.abc.com>), or by an
abbreviated form of its host name that distinguishes it from other
machines. Successful use of an abbreviated form depends on the
availability of a name service (such as the Domain Name Service or a local
host table) at the time the command is issued.

For the commands that alter the administrative files shared by all server
machines in the cell (the B<bos addhost>, B<bos addkey>, B<bos adduser>,
B<bos removehost>, B<bos removekey>, and B<bos removeuser> commands), the
appropriate machine depends on whether the cell uses the United States or
international version of AFS:

=over 4

=item *

If the cell (as recommended) uses the Update Server to distribute the
contents of the F</usr/afs/etc> directory, provide the name of the system
control machine. After issuing the command, allow up to five minutes for
the Update Server to distribute the changed file to the other AFS server
machines in the cell. If the specified machine is not the system control
machine but is running an B<upclient> process that refers to the system
control machine, then the change will be overwritten when the process next
brings over the relevant file from the system control machine.

=item *

Otherwise, repeatedly issue the command, naming each of the cell's server
machines in turn. To avoid possible inconsistency problems, finish issuing
the commands within a fairly short time.

=back

=back

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

To issue any bos command that changes a configuration file or alters
process status, the issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList>
file on the server machine named by the B<-server>
argument. Alternatively, if the B<-localauth> flag is included the issuer
must be logged on as the local superuser C<root>.

To issue a bos command that only displays information (other than the
B<bos listkeys> command), no privilege is required.
