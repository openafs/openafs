=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup labeltape> command creates a magnetic label, readable by the
Backup System, at the beginning of a tape. The label records the tape's
name (either a I<permanent name>, or an I<AFS tape name> that reflects the
tape's contents in a prescribed format) and its capacity.

(If the C<FILE YES> instruction appears in the
F</usr/afs/backup/CFG_I<device_name>> file on the Tape Coordinator machine
associated with the specified port offset, then the B<backup> command
writes label information to the first 16 KB block in the backup data file
listed for that port offset in the Tape Coordinator's
F</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file, rather than at the beginning of a
tape. For the sake of clarity, the following text refers to tapes only,
but the Backup System handles backup data files in much the same way.)

Relabeling a tape that already contains AFS backup data effectively makes
the data unusable, because the command removes the Backup Database record
of the complete dump set of which the tape is a part. Use this command to
enable recycling of a tape that contains unexpired dumps that are not
actually still needed.

To write a permanent name on the label, include the B<-pname> argument to
specify a string of up to 32 characters. The permanent name persists until
the B<-pname> argument is again included on the B<backup labeltape>
command, regardless of the tape's contents and of how often the tape is
otherwise relabeled or recycled. Include this argument or the B<-name>
argument, but not both. If this argument is included, the AFS tape name is
set to C<< <NULL> >>.  The permanent name is set to C<< <NULL> >> if this
argument is omitted and no permanent name already exists.

The issuer must ensure that a permanent name is unique among the tapes
used for AFS backup in the cell, because the B<backup> command interpreter
does not verify that another tape does not already have the same permanent
name. When a tape has a permanent name, the Backup System uses it instead
of the AFS tape name in most prompts and when referring to the tape in
output from B<backup> commands. The permanent name appears in the C<tape
name> field of the output from the B<backup readlabel> command.

To write an AFS tape name on the label, provide a value for the B<-name>
argument in the required format described in L<OPTIONS>.  Include the
B<-name> argument or the B<-pname> argument, but not both. If this
argument is omitted, the AFS tape name is set to C<< <NULL> >>, but the
Backup System automatically assigns the appropriate name when the tape is
used in a future B<backup dump> or B<backup savedb> operation.  The AFS
tape name appears in the C<AFS tape name> field of the output from the
B<backup readlabel> and B<backup scantape> commands.

The backup command interpreter does not accept the B<-name> argument if
the tape already has a permanent name. To erase a tape's permanent name,
provide a null value to the B<-pname> argument by issuing the following
command:

   % backup labeltape -pname ""

To record the tape's capacity on the label, specify a number of kilobytes
as the B<-size> argument. If the argument is omitted the first time a tape
is labeled, the Backup System records the default tape capacity recorded
for the specified port offset in the F</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file on
the Tape Coordinator machine. Subsequently, the value in the size field
persists until the B<-size> argument is again included on the B<backup
labeltape> command.

To determine how much data can be written to a tape during a backup dump
or B<backup savedb> operation, the Tape Coordinator reads the capacity
recorded on the tape's label (or uses the value associated with its port
offset in the F</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file, if the tape was never
labeled). For further description, see the B<backup dump> reference page.

The Tape Coordinator's default response to this command is to access the
tape by invoking the C<MOUNT> instruction in the local
F</usr/afs/backup/CFG_I<device_name>> file, or by prompting the backup
operator to insert the tape if there is no C<MOUNT> instruction. However,
if the C<AUTOQUERY NO> instruction appears in the F<CFG_I<device_name>>
file, or if the issuer of the B<butc> command included the B<-noautoquery>
flag, the Tape Coordinator instead expects the tape to be in the device
already.  If it is not, the Tape Coordinator invokes the C<MOUNT>
instruction or prompts the operator.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-name> <I<AFS tape name>>

Specifies the AFS tape name to record on the label. Include this argument
or the B<-pname> argument, but not both. If this argument is omitted, the
AFS tape name is set to C<< <NULL> >>.  If this argument is provided, it
must have the following format:

   <volume_set_name>.<dump_level_name>.<tape_index>

for the tape to be acceptable for use in a future backup dump
operation. The <volume_set_name> must match the volume set name of the
initial dump to be written to the tape, <dump_level_name> must match the
last element of the dump level pathname at which the volume set will be
dumped, and <tape_index> indicates the order of the tape in the dump set
(indexing begins with C<1>). To disable this type of name checking,
include the C<NAME_CHECK NO> instruction in the F<CFG_I<device_name>>
file.

For the tape to be acceptable for use in a future backup savedb operation,
the value specified for the B<-name> argument must have the following
format:

   Ubik_db_dump.<tape_index>

where <tape_index> indicates the order of the tape in the set of tapes
that house the Backup Database dump; indexing begins with C<1> (one).

=item B<-size> <I<tape size>>

Specifies the tape capacity to record on the label. Provide an integer
value followed by a letter that indicates units, with no intervening
space. A unit value of C<k> or C<K> indicates kilobytes, C<m> or C<M>
indicates megabytes, and C<g> or C<G> indicates gigabytes. If the units
letter is omitted, the default is kilobytes.

If this argument is omitted the first time a tape is labeled, the Backup
System records the capacity that is associated with the specified port
offset in the F</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file on the Tape Coordinator
machine. The value recorded the first time then persists until the
B<-size> argument is provided on a future issuance of the command.

=item B<-portoffset> <I<TC port offset>>

Specifies the port offset number of the Tape Coordinator handling the tape
for this operation.

=item B<-pname> <I<permanent tape name>>

Specifies the permanent name to record on the label. It can be up to 32
characters in length, and include any alphanumeric characters.  Avoid
metacharacters that have a special meaning to the shell, to avoid having
to mark them as literal in commands issued at the shell prompt.

Include this argument or the B<-name> argument, but not both. If this
argument is provided, the AFS tape name is set to C<< <NULL> >>. If this
argument is omitted, any existing permanent name is retained.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command records the AFS tape name C<user.monthly.1> on the
label of the tape in the device with port offset 3:

   % backup labeltape -name user.monthly.1 -portoffset 3

The following three commands are equivalent in effect: they all record a
capacity of 2 GB on the label of the tape in the device with port offset
4. They set the AFS tape name to C<< <NULL> >> and leave the permanent
name unchanged.

   % backup labeltape -size 2g -portoffset 4
   % backup labeltape -size 2048M -portoffset 4
   % backup labeltape -size 2097152 -portoffset 4

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on every
machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
