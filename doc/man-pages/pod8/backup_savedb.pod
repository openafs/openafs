=head1 NAME

backup savedb - Creates a saved copy of the Backup Database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<backup savedb> [B<-portoffset> <I<TC port offset>>]
    [B<-archive> <I<date time>>+] [B<-localauth>]
    [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>] [B<-help>]

B<backup sa> [B<-p> <I<TC port offset>>] [B<-a> <I<date time>>+]
    [B<-l>] [B<-c> <I<cell name>>] [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup savedb> command creates a backup copy of the entire Backup
Database and writes it to the tape in the device controlled by the Tape
Coordinator indicated with the B<-portoffset> argument. If the database is
damaged (as reported by the B<backup dbverify> command), this command
repairs as much of the corruption as possible as it creates the saved
copy. The Backup Server creates a dump record for the saved database in
the Backup Database (but in the disk version of the database only, not in
the version written to tape).

If the C<FILE YES> instruction appears in the
F</usr/afs/backup/CFG_I<device_name>> file associated with the specified
port offset, then the B<backup savedb> command dumps the database copy to
the backup data file listed for that port offset in the Tape Coordinator's
F</usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig> file, instead of to tape. For the sake of
clarity, the following text refers to tapes only, but the Backup System
handles backup data files in much the same way.

If the B<-archive> flag is provided, after writing the saved copy of the
database the Backup System truncates the copy of the database on disk by
deleting volume dump records with timestamps prior to the specified date
and time (it does not delete the dump records created by previous B<backup
savedb> commands, however).

If the tape to which the database copy is written has an AFS tape name, it
must be C<Ubik_db_dump.1> or C<< <NULL> >>. Any permanent name is
acceptable.

The Tape Coordinator's default response to this command is to access the
first tape by invoking the C<MOUNT> instruction in the local
F</usr/afs/backup/CFG_I<device_name>> file, or by prompting the backup
operator to insert the tape if there is no C<MOUNT> instruction. However,
if the C<AUTOQUERY NO> instruction appears in the F<CFG_I<device_name>>
file, or if the issuer of the B<butc> command included the B<-noautoquery>
flag, the Tape Coordinator instead expects the tape to be in the device
already.  If it is not, the Tape Coordinator invokes the C<MOUNT>
instruction or prompts the operator. It also invokes the C<MOUNT>
instruction or prompts for any additional tapes needed to complete the
operation; the backup operator must arrange to provide them.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-portoffset> <I<TC port offset>>

Specifies the port offset number of the Tape Coordinator handling the
tapes for this operation.

=item B<-archive> <I<date time>>+

Specifies a date and time; volume dump records with earlier timestamps are
deleted from the disk copy of the Backup Database after the Backup System
dumps the database (a dump's timestamp appears in the C<created> field of
the output from the B<backup dumpinfo> command). However, if a dump set
contains any dump created after the specified date, none of the dump
records associated with the dump set are deleted. Dump records for
previous dumps of the database (created with the B<backup savedb> command)
are never deleted; use the B<backup deletedump> command to remove them.

Provide one of two values: 

=over 4

=item *

The string C<NOW> to indicate the current date and time, in which case the
Backup System deletes all dump records except those for dumps of the
Backup Database itself.

=item *

A date value in the format I<mm/dd/yyyy> [I<hh:MM>]. The month (I<mm>),
day (I<dd>), and year (I<yyyy>) are required, and valid values for the
year range from C<1970> to C<2037>; higher values are not valid because
the latest possible date in the standard UNIX representation is in
February 2038. The Backup System automatically reduces any later date to
the maximum value.

The hour and minutes (I<hh:MM>) are optional, but if provided must be in
24-hour format (for example, the value C<14:36> represents 2:36 p.m.). If
omitted, the time defaults to 59 seconds after midnight (00:00:59
hours). Similarly, the B<backup> command interpreter automatically adds 59
seconds to any time value provided. In both cases, adding 59 seconds
compensates for how the Backup Database and B<backup dumpinfo> command
represent dump creation times in hours and minutes only. That is, the
Database records a creation timestamp of C<20:55> for any dump created
between 20:55:00 and 20:55:59. Automatically adding 59 seconds to a time
thus includes the records for all dumps created during that minute.

=back

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example writes a copy of the Backup Database to the tape
device controlled by the Tape Coordinator with port offset 1:

   % backup savedb -portoffset 1

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on every
machine where the Backup Server is running, or must be logged onto a
server machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
