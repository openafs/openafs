=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<upserver> command initializes the server portion of the Update
Server (the C<upserver> process). In the conventional configuration, its
binary file is located in the F</usr/afs/bin> directory on a file server
machine.

The B<upserver> command is not normally issued at the command shell prompt
but rather placed into a file server machine's F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig>
file with the B<bos create> command. If it is ever issued at the command
shell prompt, the issuer must be logged onto a database server machine as
the local superuser C<root>.

The B<upserver> command specifies which of the directories on the local
disk are eligible for distribution in response to requests from the client
portion of the Update Server (the B<upclient> process) running on other
machines. If no directories are specified, the B<upserver> process
distributes the contents of any directory on its local disk.

The B<upserver> process can distribute a directory's contents in encrypted
or unencrypted form. By default, it does not use encryption unless an
B<upclient> process requests it (this default is equivalent to setting the
B<-clear> flag). When the B<-crypt> flag is provided, the B<upserver>
process only fulfills requests for encrypted transfer.

The B<upclient> and B<upserver> processes always mutually authenticate,
whether or not the data they pass is encrypted; they use the key with the
highest key version number in the F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file to
construct a server ticket for mutual authentication.

This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Do not use the Update Server to distribute the contents of the
F</usr/afs/etc> directory without the B<-crypt> flag.  The contents of
this directory are sensitive.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item <I<directory>>+

Names each directory to distribute in unencrypted form (because they
appear before the first B<-crypt> or B<-clear> flag on the command
line). If this argument is omitted, all directories on the machine's local
disk are eligible for distribution.

=item B<-crypt> <I<directory>>+

Precedes a list of one or more directories that the B<upserver> process
distributes only in encrypted form.

=item B<-clear> <I<directory>>+

Precedes a list of one or more directories that the B<upserver> process
distributes in unencrypted form unless the B<upclient> process requests
them in encrypted form. Use this argument only if a list of directories
headed by the B<-crypt> flag precedes it on the command line.

=item B<-auth> <I<directory>>+

Precedes a list of one or more directories which the upserver process
distributes using a form of encryption that is intermediate in complexity
and security between the unencrypted and encrypted levels set by the
B<-clear> and B<-crypt> arguments. Do not use this argument, because the
B<upclient> process does not have a corresponding argument that it can use
to request data transfer at this level.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example bos create command defines and starts an B<upserver>
process on the host machine C<fs1.abc.com>. The last parameter (enclosed
in quotes) instructs the B<upserver> process to distribute the contents of
the F</usr/afs/bin> directory in unencrypted form and the contents of the
F</usr/afs/etc> directory in encrypted form.

   % bos create  -server fs1.abc.com -instance upserver -type simple \
       -cmd "/usr/afs/bin/upserver /usr/afs/bin -crypt /usr/afs/etc"

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the superuser C<root> on a file server
machine to issue the command at a command shell prompt. It is conventional
instead to create and start the process by issuing the B<bos create>
command.
