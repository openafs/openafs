=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos setcellname> command establishes the cell's name and makes the
server machine named by the B<-server> argument a member of it, by
recording the value of the B<-name> argument in two files which it creates
on the local disk:

=over 4

=item *

F</usr/afs/etc/ThisCell>

=item *

F</usr/afs/etc/CellServDB>. The cell name appears on the first line in the
file, preceded by the required C<< > >> symbol.  The machine name
specified with the B<-server> argument appears on the second line along
with its IP address as obtained from the cell's naming service. The
machine is thus designated as the cell's first database server machine.

=back

=head1 CAUTIONS

Issue this command only when the installing the cell's first AFS server
machine. The I<IBM AFS Quick Beginnings> explains how to copy over the
F<ThisCell> and F<CellServDB> files from this or another appropriate
machine during installation of additional server machines.

Be sure to choose a satisfactory cell name when issuing this command,
because changing a cell's name is very complicated; for one thing, it
requires changing every password in the Authentication Database.  Consult
the I<IBM AFS Administration Guide> for advice on choosing a cell name.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to set the cell name in the
F<ThisCell> and F<CellServDB> file. It is always the first machine
installed in a cell. Identify the machine by IP address or its host name
(either fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously).  For details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-name> <I<cell name>>

Defines the cell name, using standard Internet domain name format (the
actual domain name is usually appropriate). Examples are C<abc.com> for
the ABC Corporation and C<stateu.edu> for the State University. It must
match the value of the B<-cell> argument, if that is provided.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command defines the cell name C<abc.com> in the F<ThisCell>
and F<CellServDB> files on the machine C<fs1.abc.com> as it is installed
as the cell's first server machine.

   % bos setcellname -server fs1.abc.com -name abc.com

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

Authorization checking is normally turned off during installation, which
is the only recommended time to use this command; in this case no
privilege is required. If authorization checking is turned on, the issuer
must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the machine named
by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged in as the local superuser
C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is included.
