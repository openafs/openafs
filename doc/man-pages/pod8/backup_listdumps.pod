=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup listdumps> command displays the dump hierarchy from the
Backup Database.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<backup> command interpreter presents
it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the B<-cell> argument. For
more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<backup(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 OUTPUT

The output displays the complete dump hierarchy and indicates the
relationship between full and incremental dump levels. Full dump levels
appear at the left margin. The hierarchy can include more than one full
dump level; each one defines a subhierarchy of dump levels that can be
used for dumping different volume sets.

Incremental dump levels appear below and indented to the right of their
parent dump levels, which can be either full or incremental. Since
multiple incremental dump levels can share the same parent, an incremental
dump level is not always directly below its parent; the amount of
indentation indicates the parent/child relationship.

If a dump level has an associated expiration date, it appears along with
the level name. Absolute expiration dates appear in the format

   <dump_level> expires at <day month date time year>

and relative expiration dates in the format

   <dump_level> expires in {<years>y | <months>m | <days>d}

to indicate the number of years, months, days, or combination of the three
after creation a dump expires when created at this level.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example depicts six dump hierarchies. The expiration date
for all incremental dump levels is 13 days so that the corresponding tapes
can be recycled two weeks after their creation. The expiration dates for
all full dump levels is 27 days so that the corresponding tapes can be
recycled four weeks after their creation.
