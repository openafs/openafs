specified by the B<-topic> argument. If the B<-topic> argument is omitted,
the output includes the first line (name and short description) of the
online help entry for every B<kas> command.

To list every kas command whose name or short description includes a
specified keyword, use the B<kas apropos> command.

Indicates each command for which to display the complete online help
entry. Omit the B<kas> part of the command name, providing only the

setpassword>). If this argument is omitted, the output briefly describes
every B<kas> command.

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
