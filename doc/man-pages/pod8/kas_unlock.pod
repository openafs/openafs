    [B<-password_for_admin> <I<admin password>>] [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>] 
    [B<-servers> <I<explicit list of authentication servers>>+]
    [B<-noauth>] [B<-help>]

    [B<-a> <I<admin principal to use for authentication>>] 
    [B<-p> <I<admin password>>] [B<-c> <I<cell name>>] 
    [B<-s> <I<explicit list of authentication servers>>+] [B<-no>] [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<kas unlock> command unlocks the Authentication Database entry named
by the B<-name> argument. An entry becomes locked when the user exceeds
the limit on failed authentication attempts, generally by providing the
wrong password to either an AFS-modified login utility or the B<klog>
command. Use the B<kas setfields> command to set the limit and the lockout
time, and the B<kas examine> command to examine the settings.

To unlock all locked user accounts at once, shutdown the B<kaserver>
process on every database server machine, and remove the
F</usr/afs/local/kaauxdb> file from each one. The B<kaserver> process
recreates the file as it restarts.
