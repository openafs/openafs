=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<backup help> command displays the complete online help entry (short

B<-topic> argument. If the B<-topic> argument is omitted, the output
includes the first line (name and short description) of the online help

specified keyword, use the B<backup apropos> command.

Indicates each command for which to display the complete online help
entry. Omit the B<backup> part of the command name, providing only the

argument is omitted, the output briefly describes every B<backup> command.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
