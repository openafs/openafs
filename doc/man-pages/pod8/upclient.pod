=head1 NAME

upclient - Initializes the client portion of the Update Server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<upclient> <I<hostname>> [B<-crypt>] [B<-clear>] [B<-t> <I<retry time>>]
    [B<-verbose>]* <I<dir>>+ [B<-help>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The upclient command initializes the client portion of the Update
Server. In the conventional configuration, its binary file is located in
the F</usr/afs/bin> directory on a file server machine.

The upclient command is not normally issued at the command shell prompt
but rather placed into a file server machine's F</usr/afs/local/BosConfig>
file with the B<bos create> command. If it is ever issued at the command
shell prompt, the issuer must be logged onto a database server machine as
the local superuser C<root>.

The upclient process periodically checks that all files in each local
directory named by the I<dir> argument match the files in the
corresponding directory on the source machine named by the I<hostname>
argument. If a file does not match, the B<upclient> process requests the
source copy from the B<upserver> process running on the source machine.

By default, the B<upclient> process requests that the B<upserver> process
encrypt the data before transferring it.  Use the B<-clear> flag to
request unencrypted transfer if appropriate. (The B<-crypt> flag
explicitly sets the default.)

In the conventional configuration, separate instances of the B<upclient>
process request data from the F</usr/afs/bin> and F</usr/afs/etc>
directories, except on machines for which the system control machine is
also the binary distribution machine for the machine's system type. The
conventional names for the separate instances are C<upclientbin> and
C<upclientetc> respectively.

The B<upclient> and B<upserver> processes always mutually authenticate,
whether or not the data they pass is encrypted; they use the key with the
highest key version number in the F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file to
construct a server ticket for mutual authentication.

This command does not use the syntax conventions of the AFS command
suites. Provide the command name and all option names in full.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Do not use the Update Server to distribute the contents of the
F</usr/afs/etc> directory using the B<-clear> option.  The contents of
this directory are sensitive.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item <I<hostname>>

Names either the cell's system control machine (if the requested directory
is F</usr/afs/etc>), or the binary distribution machine for the local
machine's CPU and operating system type (if the requested directory is
F</usr/afs/bin>).

=item B<-crypt>

Requests the transfer of data from the upserver process in encrypted
form. This is the default; this flag just sets the default explicitly.
Do not use this flag with the B<-clear> flag.

=item B<-clear>

Requests transfer of data from the B<upserver> process in unencrypted
form. Provide this flag or the B<-crypt> flag, but not both.

=item B<-t> <I<retry time>>

Specifies how often to check for changes in each specified directory, as a
number of seconds. If this argument is omitted, the default is C<300> (5
minutes). This argument determines the maximum amount of time it takes for
a change made on the source machine to propagate to this machine.

=item B<-verbose>*

Writes a trace of the upclient process's operations on the standard output
stream, which usually corresponds to the machine console. Provide one,
two, or three instances of the flag; each additional instance generates
increasingly numerous and detailed messages.

=item <I<dir>>+

Names each directory to check for modified files. The conventional choices
are the following:

=over 4

=item *

F</usr/afs/bin>, in which case the recommended name for the process
(assigned with the B<-instance> argument to the B<bos create> command) is
C<upclientbin>. The I<hostname> is the binary distribution machine for the
local machine's system type. You may wish to use the B<-clear> flag for
the F</usr/afs/bin> directory, since binaries are not particularly
sensitive and encrypting them takes system resources.

=item *

F</usr/afs/etc>, in which case the recommended name for the process
(assigned with the B<-instance> argument to the B<bos create> command) is
C<upclientetc>. The I<hostname> is the cell's system control machine. Use
the B<-crypt> flag for the F</usr/afs/etc> directory, since it contains
the F<KeyFile> file and other data vital to cell security.

=back

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following bos create command creates an C<upclientbin> process on the
machine C<fs4.abc.com> that refers to the machine C<fs1.abc.com> as the
source for the F</usr/afs/bin> directory (thus C<fs1.abc.com> is the
binary distribution machine for machines of C<fs4.abc.com>'s type). The
files in the F</usr/afs/bin> directory are distributed every 120 seconds.
The command requests transfer in unencrypted form.

   % bos create  -server fs4.abc.com -instance upclientbin -type simple \
                 -cmd "/usr/afs/bin/upclient fs1.abc.com -clear \
                 -t 120 /usr/afs/bin"

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be logged in as the superuser C<root> on a file server
machine to issue the command at a command shell prompt. It is conventional
instead to create and start the process by issuing the B<bos create>
command.
