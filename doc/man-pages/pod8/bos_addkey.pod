=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos addkey> command constructs a server encryption key from the text
string provided, assigns it the key version number specified with the
B<-kvno> argument, and adds it to the F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument. Be sure to use the B<kas
setpassword> or B<kas setkey> command to add the same key to the C<afs>
entry in the Authentication Database.

Do not use the B<-key> argument, which echoes the password string visibly
on the screen. If the argument is omitted, the BOS Server prompts for the
string and does not echo it visibly:

   Input key:
   Retype input key:

The BOS Server prohibits reuse of any key version number already listed in
the F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. This ensures that users who still have
tickets sealed with the current key are not prevented from communicating
with a server process because the current key is overwritten with a new
key. Use the B<bos listkeys> command to display the key version numbers in
the F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to change the
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. Identify the machine by IP address or its
host name (either fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For
details, see L<bos(8)>.

In cells that use the Update Server to distribute the contents of the
F</usr/afs/etc> directory, it is conventional to specify only the system
control machine as a value for the B<-server> argument. Otherwise, repeat
the command for each file server machine. For further discussion, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-key> <I<key>>

Specifies a character string just like a password; the BOS Server calls a
DES conversion function to encode it into a form appropriate for use as an
encryption key. Omit this argument to have the BOS Server prompt for the
string instead.

=item B<-kvno> <I<key version number>>

Defines the new key's key version number. It must be an integer in the
range from C<0> (zero) through C<255>.  For the sake of simplicity, use
the number one higher than the current highest key version number; use the
B<bos listkeys> command to display key version numbers.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not combine
this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

If the strings typed at the C<Input key> and C<Retype input key> prompts
do not match, the following message appears, and the command exits without
adding a new key:

   Input key mismatch

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command adds a new server encryption key with key version
number 14 to the B<KeyFile> file kept on the machine C<fs1.abc.com> (the
system control machine). The issuer omits the B<-key> argument, as
recommended, and provides the password at the prompts.

   % bos addkey -server fs1.abc.com -kvno 14
   Input key:
   Retype input key:

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
