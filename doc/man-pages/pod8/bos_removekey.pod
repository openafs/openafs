=head1 NAME

bos removekey - Removes a server encryption key from the KeyFile file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<bos removekey> B<-server> <I<machine name>>
    B<-kvno> <I<key version number>>+ [B<-cell> <I<cell name>>]
    [B<-noauth>] [B<-localauth>] [B<-help>]

B<bos removek> B<-s> <I<machine name>> B<-k> <I<key version number>>+
    [B<-c> <I<cell name>>] [B<-n>] [B<-l>] [B<-h>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<bos removekey> command removes each specified encryption key from
the F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file on the machine named by the B<-server>
argument. Use the B<-kvno> argument to identify each key by its key
version number; use the B<bos listkeys> command to display the key version
numbers.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Before removing a obsolete key, verify that the cell's maximum ticket
lifetime has passed since the current key was defined using the B<kas
setpassword> and B<bos addkey> commands. This ensures that no clients
still possess tickets encrypted with the obsolete key.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Indicates the server machine on which to change the
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. Identify the machine by IP address or its
host name (either fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For
details, see L<bos(8)>.

In cells that use the Update Server to distribute the contents of the
F</usr/afs/etc> directory, it is conventional to specify only the system
control machine as a value for the B<-server> argument. Otherwise, repeat
the command for each file server machine. For further discussion, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-kvno> <I<key version number>>+

Specifies the key version number of each key to remove.

=item B<-cell> <I<cell name>>

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this argument
with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-noauth>

Assigns the unprivileged identity C<anonymous> to the issuer. Do not
combine this flag with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-localauth>

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
F</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<bos> command interpreter presents the
ticket to the BOS Server during mutual authentication. Do not combine this
flag with the B<-cell> or B<-noauth> options. For more details, see
L<bos(8)>.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command removes the keys with key version numbers 5 and 6
from the F<KeyFile> file on the system control machine C<fs1.abc.com>.

   % bos removekey -server fs1.abc.com -kvno 5 6

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine named by the B<-server> argument, or must be logged onto a server
machine as the local superuser C<root> if the B<-localauth> flag is
included.
