.IX Title "FS_LISTACL 1"

.SH "NAME"
fs listacl \- Displays ACLs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"

\&\fBfs lista\fR [\fB\-p\fR\ <\fIdir/file\ path\fR>+] [\fB\-id\fR] [\fB\-if\fR] [\fB\-h\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfs listacl\fR command displays the access control list (\s-1ACL\s0)
associated with each specified file, directory, or symbolic link. The
specified element can reside in the \s-1DFS\s0 filespace if the issuer is using
the \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration Toolkit Protocol Translator to access \s-1DFS\s0 data (and
\&\s-1DFS\s0 does implement per-file ACLs). To display the \s-1ACL\s0 of the current
working directory, omit the \fB\-path\fR argument.
.PP
To alter an \s-1ACL\s0, use the fs setacl command. To copy an \s-1ACL\s0 from one
directory to another, use the \fBfs copyacl\fR command. To remove obsolete
entries from an \s-1ACL\s0, use the \fBfs cleanacl\fR command.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
Placing a user or group on the \f(CW\*(C`Negative rights\*(C'\fR section of the \s-1ACL\s0 does
not guarantee denial of permissions, if the \f(CW\*(C`Normal rights\*(C'\fR section
grants the permissions to members of the system:anyuser group. In that
case, the user needs only to issue the \fBunlog\fR command to obtain the
permissions granted to the system:anyuser group.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-path\fR <\fIdir/file path\fR>+" 4
.IX Item "-path <dir/file path>+"
Names each directory or file for which to display the \s-1ACL\s0. For \s-1AFS\s0 files,
the output displays the \s-1ACL\s0 from the file's parent directory; \s-1DFS\s0 files do
have their own \s-1ACL\s0. Incomplete pathnames are interpreted relative to the
current working directory, which is also the default value if this
argument is omitted.
.IP "\fB\-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-id"
Displays the Initial Container \s-1ACL\s0 of each \s-1DFS\s0 directory. This argument is
supported only on \s-1DFS\s0 directories accessed via the \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration
Toolkit Protocol Translator.
.IP "\fB\-if\fR" 4
.IX Item "-if"
Displays the Initial Object \s-1ACL\s0 of each \s-1DFS\s0 directory. This argument is
supported only on \s-1DFS\s0 directories accessed via the \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration
Toolkit Protocol Translator.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
The first line of the output for each file, directory, or symbolic link
reads as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Access list for <directory> is
.Ve
.PP
If the issuer used shorthand notation in the pathname, such as the period
(\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR) to represent the current current directory, that notation sometimes
appears instead of the full pathname of the directory.
.PP
Next, the \f(CW\*(C`Normal rights\*(C'\fR header precedes a list of users and groups who
are granted the indicated permissions, with one pairing of user or group
and permissions on each line. If negative permissions have been assigned
to any user or group, those entries follow a \f(CW\*(C`Negative rights\*(C'\fR
header. The format of negative entries is the same as those on the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Normal rights\*(C'\fR section of the \s-1ACL\s0, but the user or group is denied
rather than granted the indicated permissions.
.PP
\&\s-1AFS\s0 does not implement per-file ACLs, so for a file the command displays
the \s-1ACL\s0 on its directory. The output for a symbolic link displays the \s-1ACL\s0
that applies to its target file or directory, rather than the \s-1ACL\s0 on the
directory that houses the symbolic link.
.PP
The permissions for \s-1AFS\s0 enable the possessor to perform the indicated
action:
.IP "a (administer)" 4
.IX Item "a (administer)"
Change the entries on the \s-1ACL\s0.
.IP "d (delete)" 4
.IX Item "d (delete)"
Remove files and subdirectories from the directory or move them to other
directories.
.IP "i (insert)" 4
.IX Item "i (insert)"
Add files or subdirectories to the directory by copying, moving or
creating.
.IP "k (lock)" 4
.IX Item "k (lock)"
Set read locks or write locks on the files in the directory.
.IP "l (lookup)" 4
.IX Item "l (lookup)"
List the files and subdirectories in the directory, stat the directory
itself, and issue the \fBfs listacl\fR command to examine the directory's
\&\s-1ACL\s0.
.IP "r (read)" 4
.IX Item "r (read)"
Read the contents of files in the directory; issue the \f(CW\*(C`ls \-l\*(C'\fR command to
stat the elements in the directory.
.IP "w (write)" 4
.IX Item "w (write)"
Modify the contents of files in the directory, and issue the \s-1UNIX\s0 \fBchmod\fR
command to change their mode bits
.IP "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H" 4
.IX Item "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H"
Have no default meaning to the \s-1AFS\s0 server processes, but are made
available for applications to use in controlling access to the directory's
contents in additional ways. The letters must be uppercase.
.PP
For \s-1DFS\s0 files and directories, the permissions are similar, except that
the \s-1DFS\s0 \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR (execute) permission replaces the \s-1AFS\s0 \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR (lookup)
permission, \s-1DFS\s0 \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR (control) replaces \s-1AFS\s0 \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR (administer), and there
is no \s-1DFS\s0 equivalent to the \s-1AFS\s0 \f(CW\*(C`k\*(C'\fR (lock) permission. The meanings of
the various permissions also differ slightly, and \s-1DFS\s0 does not implement
negative permissions. For a complete description of \s-1DFS\s0 permissions, see
the \s-1DFS\s0 documentation and the \fI\s-1IBM\s0 \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration Toolkit
Administration Guide and Reference\fR.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

The following command displays the \s-1ACL\s0 on the home directory of the user

.SH "PRIVILEGE REQUIRED"
.IX Header "PRIVILEGE REQUIRED"
If the \fB\-path\fR argument names an \s-1AFS\s0 directory, the issuer must have the
\&\f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR (lookup) permission on its \s-1ACL\s0 and the \s-1ACL\s0 for every directory that
precedes it in the pathname.
.PP
If the \fB\-path\fR argument names an \s-1AFS\s0 file, the issuer must have the \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR
(lookup) and \f(CW\*(C`r\*(C'\fR (read) permissions on the \s-1ACL\s0 of the file's directory,
and the \fBl\fR permission on the \s-1ACL\s0 of each directory that precedes it in
the pathname.
.PP
If the \fB\-path\fR argument names a \s-1DFS\s0 directory or file, the issuer must
have the \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR (execute) permission on its \s-1ACL\s0 and on the \s-1ACL\s0 of each
directory that precedes it in the pathname.
