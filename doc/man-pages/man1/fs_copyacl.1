fs copyacl \- Copies an ACL from a directory to one or more other directories

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The fs copyacl command copies the access control list (\s-1ACL\s0) from a source
directory to each specified destination directory. The source directory's
\&\s-1ACL\s0 is unchanged, and changes to the destination directory's \s-1ACL\s0 obey the
following rules:
.IP "\(bu" 4
If an entry on the source \s-1ACL\s0 does not already exist on the destination
\&\s-1ACL\s0, it is added.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If an entry exists on both the source and destination ACLs, the
permissions from the source \s-1ACL\s0 entry replace the current permissions on
the destination \s-1ACL\s0 entry.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If an entry on the destination \s-1ACL\s0 has no corresponding entry on the
source \s-1ACL\s0, it is removed if the \fB\-clear\fR flag is included and is
unchanged otherwise. In other words, if the \fB\-clear\fR flag is provided,
the source \s-1ACL\s0 completely replaces the destination \s-1ACL\s0.
.PP
When using this command to copy ACLs between objects in \s-1DFS\s0 filespace
accessed via the \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration Toolkit Protocol Translator, it is
possible to specify files, as well as directories, with the \fB\-fromdir\fR
and \fB\-todir\fR arguments. For more information on copying ACLs between \s-1DFS\s0
directories and files, refer to the \fI\s-1IBM\s0 \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration Toolkit
Administration Guide and Reference\fR.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
Do not copy ACLs between \s-1AFS\s0 and \s-1DFS\s0 files or directories. The \s-1ACL\s0 formats
are incompatible.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-fromdir\fR <\fIsource directory\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-fromdir <source directory>"
Specifies the source directory from which to copy the \s-1ACL\s0.  (Specifying an
\&\s-1AFS\s0 file copies its directory's \s-1ACL\s0, but specifying a \s-1DFS\s0 file copies its
own \s-1ACL\s0.) A partial pathname is interpreted relative to the current
working directory.
.IP "\fB\-todir\fR <\fIdestination directory\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-todir <destination directory>"
Specifies each directory for which to alter the \s-1ACL\s0 to match the source
\&\s-1ACL\s0. (Specifying an \s-1AFS\s0 file halts the command with an error, but
specifying a \s-1DFS\s0 file alters the file's \s-1ACL\s0). A partial pathname is
interpreted relative to the current working directory.
.Sp
Specify the read/write path to each directory (or \s-1DFS\s0 file), to avoid the
failure that results from attempting to change a read-only volume. By
convention, the read/write path is indicated by placing a period before
the cell name at the pathname's second level (for example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`/afs/.abc.com\*(C'\fR). For further discussion of the concept of read/write and
read-only paths through the filespace, see the \fBfs mkmount\fR reference
page.
.IP "\fB\-clear\fR" 4
.IX Item "-clear"
Replaces the \s-1ACL\s0 of each destination directory with the source \s-1ACL\s0.
.IP "\fB\-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-id"
Modifies the Initial Container \s-1ACL\s0 of each \s-1DFS\s0 directory named by the
\&\fB\-todir\fR argument, rather than the regular Object \s-1ACL\s0. This argument is
supported only when both the source and each destination directory reside
in \s-1DFS\s0 and are accessed via the \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration Toolkit Protocol
Translator.
.IP "\fB\-if\fR" 4
.IX Item "-if"
Modifies the Initial Object \s-1ACL\s0 of each \s-1DFS\s0 directory named by the
\&\fB\-todir\fR argument, rather than the regular Object \s-1ACL\s0. This argument is
supported only when both the source and each destination directory reside
in \s-1DFS\s0 and are accessed via the \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration Toolkit Protocol
Translator.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
The following example command copies the current working directory's \s-1ACL\s0
to its subdirectory called \fIreports\fR. Note that the source directory's
\&\s-1ACL\s0 is unaffected. Entries on the \fIreports\fR directory's that are not on
the source \s-1ACL\s0 of the current directory remain unaffected as well, because
the \fB\-clear\fR flag is not used.

.SH "PRIVILEGE REQUIRED"
.IX Header "PRIVILEGE REQUIRED"
To copy an \s-1ACL\s0 between \s-1AFS\s0 objects, the issuer must have the \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR (lookup)
permission on the source directory's \s-1ACL\s0 and the \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR (administer)
permission on each destination directory's \s-1ACL\s0. If the \fB\-fromdir\fR
argument names a file rather than a directory, the issuer must have both
the \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`r\*(C'\fR (read) permissions on the \s-1ACL\s0 of the file's directory.
.PP
To copy an \s-1ACL\s0 between \s-1DFS\s0 objects, the issuer must have the r permission
