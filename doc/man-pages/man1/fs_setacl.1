.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBfs setacl\fR command adds the access control list (\s-1ACL\s0) entries
specified with the \fB\-acl\fR argument to the \s-1ACL\s0 of each directory named by
the \fB\-dir\fR argument.
.PP
If the \fB\-dir\fR argument designates a pathname in \s-1DFS\s0 filespace (accessed
via the \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration Toolkit Protocol Translator), it can be a file
as well as a directory. The \s-1ACL\s0 must already include an entry for
\&\f(CW\*(C`mask_obj\*(C'\fR, however. For more details, refer to the \fI\s-1IBM\s0 \s-1AFS/DFS\s0
Migration Toolkit Administration Guide and Reference\fR.
.PP
Only user and group entries are acceptable values for the \fB\-acl\fR
argument. Do not place machine entries (\s-1IP\s0 addresses) directly on an \s-1ACL\s0;
instead, make the machine entry a group member and place the group on the
\&\s-1ACL\s0.
.PP
To completely erase the existing \s-1ACL\s0 before adding the new entries,
provide the \fB\-clear\fR flag. To add the specified entries to the \f(CW\*(C`Negative
rights\*(C'\fR section of the \s-1ACL\s0 (deny rights to specified users or groups),
provide the \fB\-negative\fR flag.
.PP
To display an \s-1ACL\s0, use the fs listacl command. To copy an \s-1ACL\s0 from one
directory to another, use the \fBfs copyacl\fR command.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
If the \s-1ACL\s0 already grants certain permissions to a user or group, the
permissions specified with the \fBfs setacl\fR command replace the existing
permissions, rather than being added to them.
.PP
Setting negative permissions is generally unnecessary and not
recommended. Simply omitting a user or group from the \f(CW\*(C`Normal rights\*(C'\fR
section of the \s-1ACL\s0 is normally adequate to prevent access. In particular,
note that it is futile to deny permissions that are granted to members of
the system:anyuser group on the same \s-1ACL\s0; the user needs only to issue the
\&\fBunlog\fR command to receive the denied permissions.
.PP
When including the \fB\-clear\fR option, be sure to reinstate an entry for
each directory's owner that includes at least the \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR (lookup)
permission. Without that permission, it is impossible to resolve the \*(L"dot\*(R"
(\f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR) and \*(L"dot dot\*(R" (\f(CW\*(C`..\*(C'\fR) shorthand from within the directory. (The
directory's owner does implicitly have the \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR (administer) permission
even on a cleared \s-1ACL\s0, but must know to use it to add other permissions.)
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-dir\fR <\fIdirectory\fR>+" 4
.IX Item "-dir <directory>+"
Names each \s-1AFS\s0 directory, or \s-1DFS\s0 directory or file, for which the set the
\&\s-1ACL\s0. Partial pathnames are interpreted relative to the current working
directory.
.Sp
Specify the read/write path to each directory (or \s-1DFS\s0 file), to avoid the
failure that results from attempting to change a read-only volume. By
convention, the read/write path is indicated by placing a period before
the cell name at the pathname's second level (for example,
\&\fI/afs/.abc.com\fR). For further discussion of the concept of read/write and
read-only paths through the filespace, see the \fBfs mkmount\fR reference
page.
.IP "\fB\-acl\fR <\fIaccess list entries\fR>+" 4
.IX Item "-acl <access list entries>+"
Defines a list of one or more \s-1ACL\s0 entries, each a pair that names:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
A user name or group name as listed in the Protection Database.
.IP "*" 4
One or more \s-1ACL\s0 permissions, indicated either by combining the individual
letters or by one of the four acceptable shorthand words.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
in that order, separated by a space (thus every instance of this argument
has two parts). The accepted \s-1AFS\s0 abbreviations and shorthand words, and
the meaning of each, are as follows:
.IP "a (administer)" 4
.IX Item "a (administer)"
Change the entries on the \s-1ACL\s0.
.IP "d (delete)" 4
.IX Item "d (delete)"
Remove files and subdirectories from the directory or move them to other
directories.
.IP "i (insert)" 4
.IX Item "i (insert)"
Add files or subdirectories to the directory by copying, moving or
creating.
.IP "k (lock)" 4
.IX Item "k (lock)"
Set read locks or write locks on the files in the directory.
.IP "l (lookup)" 4
.IX Item "l (lookup)"
List the files and subdirectories in the directory, stat the directory
itself, and issue the \fBfs listacl\fR command to examine the directory's
\&\s-1ACL\s0.
.IP "r (read)" 4
.IX Item "r (read)"
Read the contents of files in the directory; issue the \f(CW\*(C`ls \-l\*(C'\fR command to
stat the elements in the directory.
.IP "w (write)" 4
.IX Item "w (write)"
Modify the contents of files in the directory, and issue the \s-1UNIX\s0 \fBchmod\fR
command to change their mode bits.
.IP "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H" 4
.IX Item "A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H"
Have no default meaning to the \s-1AFS\s0 server processes, but are made
available for applications to use in controlling access to the directory's
contents in additional ways. The letters must be uppercase.
.IP "all" 4
.IX Item "all"
Equals all seven permissions (\f(CW\*(C`rlidwka\*(C'\fR).
.IP "none" 4
.IX Item "none"
No permissions. Removes the user/group from the \s-1ACL\s0, but does not
guarantee they have no permissions if they belong to groups that remain on
the \s-1ACL\s0.
.IP "read" 4
.IX Item "read"
Equals the \f(CW\*(C`r\*(C'\fR (read) and \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR (lookup) permissions.
.IP "write" 4
.IX Item "write"
Equals all permissions except \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR (administer), that is, \f(CW\*(C`rlidwk\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
It is acceptable to mix entries that combine the individual letters with
entries that use the shorthand words, but not use both types of notation
within an individual pairing of user or group and permissions.
.Sp
To learn the proper format and acceptable values for \s-1DFS\s0 \s-1ACL\s0 entries, see
the \fI\s-1IBM\s0 \s-1AFS/DFS\s0 Migration Toolkit Administration Guide and Reference\fR.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-clear\fR" 4
.IX Item "-clear"
Removes all existing entries on each \s-1ACL\s0 before adding the entries
specified with the \fB\-acl\fR argument.
.IP "\fB\-negative\fR" 4
.IX Item "-negative"
Places the specified \s-1ACL\s0 entries in the \f(CW\*(C`Negative rights\*(C'\fR section of each
\&\s-1ACL\s0, explicitly denying the rights to the user or group, even if entries
on the accompanying \f(CW\*(C`Normal rights\*(C'\fR section of the \s-1ACL\s0 grant them
permissions.
.Sp
This argument is not supported for \s-1DFS\s0 files or directories, because \s-1DFS\s0
does not implement negative \s-1ACL\s0 permissions.
.IP "\fB\-id\fR" 4
.IX Item "-id"
Places the \s-1ACL\s0 entries on the Initial Container \s-1ACL\s0 of each \s-1DFS\s0 directory,
which are the only file system objects for which this flag is supported.
.IP "\fB\-if\fR" 4
.IX Item "-if"
Places the \s-1ACL\s0 entries on the Initial Object \s-1ACL\s0 of each \s-1DFS\s0 directory,
which are the only file system objects for which this flag is supported.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
The following example adds two entries to the \f(CW\*(C`Normal rights\*(C'\fR section of
the current working directory's \s-1ACL:\s0 the first entry grants \f(CW\*(C`r\*(C'\fR (read)
and \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR (lookup) permissions to the group pat:friends, while the other
(using the \f(CW\*(C`write\*(C'\fR shorthand) gives all permissions except \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR
