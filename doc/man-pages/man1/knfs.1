.IX Title "KNFS 1"

knfs \- Establishes authenticated access via the NFS/AFS Translator
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBknfs\fR \fB\-host\fR\ <\fIhost\ name\fR> [\fB\-id\fR\ <\fIuser\ \s-1ID\s0\ (decimal)\fR>]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBknfs\fR command creates an \s-1AFS\s0 credential structure on the local
machine, identifying it by a process authentication group (\s-1PAG\s0) number
associated with the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine named by the \fB\-hostname\fR argument
and by default with a local \s-1UID\s0 on the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine that matches the
issuer's local \s-1UID\s0 on the local machine. It places in the credential
structure the \s-1AFS\s0 tokens that the issuer has previously obtained (by
logging onto the local machine if an AFS-modified login utility is
installed, by issuing the \fBklog\fR command, or both). To associate the
credential structure with an \s-1NFS\s0 \s-1UID\s0 that does not match the issuer's
local \s-1UID\s0, use the \fB\-id\fR argument.
.PP
Issue this command only on the \s-1NFS\s0(R)/AFS translator machine that is
serving the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine, after obtaining \s-1AFS\s0 tokens on the
translator machine for every cell to which authenticated access is
required. The Cache Manager on the translator machine uses the tokens to
obtain authenticated \s-1AFS\s0 access for the designated user working on the \s-1NFS\s0
client machine. This command is not effective if issued on an \s-1NFS\s0 client
machine.
.PP
To enable the user on the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine to issue \s-1AFS\s0 commands, use
the \fB\-sysname\fR argument to specify the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine's system type,
which can differ from the translator machine's. The \s-1NFS\s0 client machine
must be a system type for which \s-1AFS\s0 is supported.
.PP
The \fB\-unlog\fR flag discards the tokens in the credential structure, but
does not destroy the credential structure itself. The Cache Manager on the
translator machine retains the credential structure until the next reboot,
and uses it each time the issuer accesses \s-1AFS\s0 through the translator
machine. The credential structure only has tokens in it if the user
reissues the \fBknfs\fR command on the translator machine each time the user
logs into the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine.
.PP
To display the tokens associated with the designated user on the \s-1NFS\s0
client machine, include the \fB\-tokens\fR flag.
.PP
Users working on \s-1NFS\s0 client machines of system types for which \s-1AFS\s0
binaries are available can use the \fBklog\fR command rather than the \fBknfs\fR
command.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
If the translator machine's administrator has enabled \s-1UID\s0 checking by
issuing the \fBfs exportafs\fR command with the \fB\-uidcheck on\fR argument, it
is not possible to use the \fB\-id\fR argument to assign the tokens to an \s-1NFS\s0
\&\s-1UID\s0 that differs from the issuer's local \s-1UID\s0. In this case, there is no
point in including the \fB\-id\fR argument, because the only acceptable value
(the issuer's local \s-1UID\s0) is the value used when the \fB\-id\fR argument is
omitted. Requiring matching UIDs is effective only when users have the
same local \s-1UID\s0 on the translator machine as on \s-1NFS\s0 client machines. In
that case, it guarantees that users assign their tokens only to their own
\&\s-1NFS\s0 sessions.
.PP
This command does not make it possible for users working on non-supported
system types to issue \s-1AFS\s0 commands. This is possible only on \s-1NFS\s0 clients
of a system type for which \s-1AFS\s0 is available.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-host\fR <\fIhost name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-host <host name>"
Names the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine on which the issuer is to work.  Providing a
fully-qualified hostname is best, but abbreviated forms are possibly
acceptable depending on the state of the cell's name server at the time
the command is issued.
.IP "\fB\-id\fR <\fIuser \s-1ID\s0 (decimal)\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-id <user ID (decimal)>"
Specifies the local \s-1UID\s0 on the \s-1NFS\s0 client to which to assign the
tokens. The \s-1NFS\s0 client identifies file requests by the \s-1NFS\s0 \s-1UID\s0, so
creating the association enables the Cache Manager on the translator
machine to use the appropriate tokens when filling the requests. If this
argument is omitted, the command interpreter uses an \s-1NFS\s0 \s-1UID\s0 that matches
the issuer's local \s-1UID\s0 on the translator machine (as returned by the
\&\fIgetuid()\fR function).
.IP "\fB\-sysname\fR <\fIhost's '@sys' value\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-sysname <host's '@sys' value>"
Specifies the value that the local (translator) machine's remote executor
daemon substitutes for the \fI@sys\fR variable in pathnames when executing
\&\s-1AFS\s0 commands issued on the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine (which must be a supported
system type). If the \s-1NFS\s0 user's \s-1PATH\s0 environment variable uses the \fI@sys\fR
variable in the pathnames for directories that house \s-1AFS\s0 binaries (as
recommended), then setting this argument enables \s-1NFS\s0 users to issue \s-1AFS\s0
commands by leading the remote executor daemon to access the \s-1AFS\s0 binaries
appropriate to the \s-1NFS\s0 client machine even if its system type differs from
the translator machine's.
.IP "\fB\-unlog\fR" 4
.IX Item "-unlog"
Discards the tokens stored in the credential structure identified by the
\&\s-1PAG\s0 associated with the \fB\-host\fR argument and, optionally, the \fB\-id\fR
argument.
.IP "\fB\-tokens\fR" 4
.IX Item "-tokens"
Displays the \s-1AFS\s0 tokens assigned to the designated user on the indicated
\&\s-1NFS\s0 client machine.
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
The following error message indicates that \s-1UID\s0 checking is enabled on the
translator machine and that the value provided for the \fB\-id\fR argument
differs from the issuer's local \s-1UID\s0.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

The following example illustrates a typical use of this command. The
issuer \f(CW\*(C`smith\*(C'\fR is working on the machine \f(CW\*(C`nfscli1.abc.com\*(C'\fR and has user
\&\s-1ID\s0 \f(CW1020\fR on that machine. The translator machine \f(CW\*(C`tx4.abc.com\*(C'\fR uses an
AFS-modified login utility, so \f(CW\*(C`smith\*(C'\fR obtains tokens for the \s-1ABC\s0
Corporation cell automatically upon login via the \fBtelnet\fR program. She
then issues the \fBklog\fR command to obtain tokens as \f(CW\*(C`admin\*(C'\fR in the \s-1ABC\s0
Corporation's test cell, \f(CW\*(C`test.abc.com\*(C'\fR, and the \fBknfs\fR command to
associate both tokens with the credential structure identified by machine
name \f(CW\*(C`nfs\-cli1\*(C'\fR and user \s-1ID\s0 \f(CW1020\fR. She breaks the connection to \f(CW\*(C`tx4\*(C'\fR
and works on \f(CW\*(C`nfscli1\*(C'\fR.
