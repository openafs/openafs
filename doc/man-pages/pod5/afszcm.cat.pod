=head1 NAME

afszcm.cat - Error message catalog for debugging the Cache Manager

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The afszcm.cat file is a message catalog for the Cache
Manager. The B<fstrace dump> command interpreter uses it in
conjunction with the standard UNIX catalog utilities to translate Cache
Manager operation codes into character strings as it writes traces in the
B<fstrace> trace log, which makes the log more readable.

The conventional location for the file is the /usr/vice/etc/C/
directory. It can be placed in another directory if the NLSPATH and
LANG environment variables are set appropriately.
