=head1 NAME

AuthLog.dir, AuthLog.pag - Log of Authentication Server privileged operations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<AuthLog.dir> and F<AuthLog.pag> files record a trace of privileged
operations performed by the Authentication Server (B<kaserver> process) on
the local machine. If the files do not exist when the Authentication
Server starts, it creates them in the F</usr/afs/logs> directory as
necessary.

The files are in binary format. To display their contents, use the B<kdb>
command, which requires being logged in to the local machine as the local
superuser C<root>.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The Authentication Server is possibly unable to create these files on some
operating systems that AFS otherwise supports, making the B<kdb> command
inoperative. See the I<IBM AFS Release Notes> for details.
