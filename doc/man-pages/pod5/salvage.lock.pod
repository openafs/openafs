=head1 NAME

salvage.lock - Prevents multiple simultaneous salvage operations on a partition

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The salvage.lock file guarantees that only one Salvager
(B<salvager> process) runs at a time on a file server machine (the
single process can fork multiple subprocesses to salvage multiple partitions
in parallel). As the Salvager initializes, it creates the empty
(zero-length) file in the B</usr/afs/local> directory and invokes the
B<flock> system call on it. It removes the file when it
completes the salvage operation. Because the Salvager must lock the
file to run, only one Salvager can run at a time.
