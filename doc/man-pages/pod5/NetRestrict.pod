=head1 NAME

NetRestrict - Defines interfaces not to register with AFS servers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

There are two F<NetRestrict> files, one for an AFS client and one for an
AFS File Server or database server.  The AFS client F<NetRestrict> file
specifies the IP addresses that the client should not register with the
File Servers it connects to.  The server F<NetRestrict> file specifies
what interfaces should not be registered with AFS Database Servers or used
to talk to other database servers.

=head2 Client NetRestrict

The F<NetRestrict> file, if present in a client machine's F</usr/vice/etc>
directory, defines the IP addresses of the interfaces that the local Cache
Manager does not register with a File Server when first establishing a
connection to it. For an explanation of how the File Server uses the
registered interfaces, see L<NetInfo(5)>.

As it initializes, the Cache Manager constructs a list of interfaces to
register, from the F</usr/vice/etc/NetInfo> file if it exists, or from the
list of interfaces configured with the operating system otherwise.  The
Cache Manager then removes from the list any addresses that appear in the
F<NetRestrict> file, if it exists. The Cache Manager records the resulting
list in kernel memory.

The F<NetRestrict> file is in ASCII format. One IP address appears on each
line, in dotted decimal format. The order of the addresses is not
significant. The value C<255> is a wildcard that represents all possible
addresses in that field. For example, the value C<192.12.105.255>
indicates that the Cache Manager does not register any of the addresses in
the C<192.12.105> subnet.

To display the addresses the Cache Manager is currently registering with
File Servers, use the B<fs getclientaddrs> command.

=head2 Server NetRestrict

The F<NetRestrict> file, if present in the F</usr/afs/local> directory,
defines the following:

=over 4

=item *

On a file server machine, the local interfaces that the File Server
(B<fileserver> process) does not register in the Volume Location Database
(VLDB) at initialization time.

=item *

On a database server machine, the local interfaces that the Ubik
synchronization library does not use when communicating with the database
server processes running on other database server machines.

=back

As it initializes, the File Server constructs a list of interfaces to
register, from the F</usr/afs/local/NetInfo> file if it exists, or from
the list of interfaces configured with the operating system otherwise. The
File Server then removes from the list any addresses that appear in the
F<NetRestrict> file, if it exists. The File Server records the resulting
list in the F</usr/afs/local/sysid> file and registers the interfaces in
the VLDB. The database server processes use a similar procedure when
initializing, to determine which interfaces to use for communication with
the peer processes on other database machines in the cell.

The F<NetRestrict> file is in ASCII format. One IP address appears on each
line, in dotted decimal format. The order of the addresses is not
significant. The value C<255> is a wildcard that represents all possible
addresses in that field. For example, the value C<192.12.105.255>
indicates that the File Server or database server processes do not
register or use any of the addresses in the C<192.12.105> subnet.

To display the File Server interface addresses registered in the VLDB, use
the B<vos listaddrs> command.
