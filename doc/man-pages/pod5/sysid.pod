=head1 NAME

sysid - Lists file server machine interface addresses registered in VLDB

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<sysid> file records the network interface addresses that the File
Server (B<fileserver> process) registers in the Volume Location Database
(VLDB) for the local file server machine.

Each time the File Server restarts, it builds a list of interfaces on the
local machine by reading the F</usr/afs/local/NetInfo> file, if it
exists. If the file does not exist, the File Server uses the list of
network interfaces configured with the operating system. It then removes
from the list any addresses that appear in the
F</usr/afs/local/NetRestrict> file, if it exists. The File Server records
the resulting list in the binary-format F<sysid> file and registers the
interfaces in the VLDB.

When the Cache Manager requests volume location information, the Volume
Location (VL) Server provides all of the interfaces registered for each
server machine that houses the volume. This enables the Cache Manager to
make use of multiple addresses when accessing AFS data stored on a
multihomed file server machine.

=head1 CAUTIONS

The F<sysid> file is unique to each file server machine, and must not be
copied from one machine to another. If it is a common practice in the cell
to copy the contents of the F</usr/afs/local> directory from an existing
file server machine to a newly installed one, be sure to remove the
F<sysid> file from the new machine before starting the C<fs> trio of
processes, which includes the B<fileserver> process.

Some versions of AFS limit how many of a file server machine's interface
addresses that can be registered. Consult the I<IBM AFS Release Notes>.
