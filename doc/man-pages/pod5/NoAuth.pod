NoAuth - Disables authorization checking

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The NoAuth file, if present in a server machine's
B</usr/afs/local> directory, indicates to the AFS server processes
running on the machine that it is not necessary to perform authorization
checking. They perform any action for any user who logs into the
machine's local file system or issues a remote command that affects the
machine's AFS server functioning, such as commands from the AFS command
suites. Because failure to check authorization exposes the
machine's AFS server functionality to attack, there are normally only two
circumstances in which the file is present:

=over 4

=item *

During installation of the machine, as instructed in the I<IBM AFS
Quick Beginnings>


=item *

During correction of a server encryption key emergency, as discussed in
the I<IBM AFS Administration Guide>


=back

In all other circumstances, the absence of the file means that the AFS
server processes perform authorization checking, verifying that the issuer of
a command has the required privilege.

Create the file in one of the following ways:

=over 4

=item *

By issuing the bosserver initialization command with the
B<-noauth> flag, if the Basic OverSeer (BOS) Server is not already
running


=item *

By issuing the B<bos setauth> command with off as the
value for the B<-authrequired> argument, if the BOS Server is already
running


=back

To remove the file, issue the bos setauth command with
B<on> as the value for the B<-authrequired> argument.

The file's contents, if any, are ignored; an empty (zero-length)
file is effective.
