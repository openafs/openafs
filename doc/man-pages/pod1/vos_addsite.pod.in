=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos addsite> command defines a new read-only site (partition on a
file server machine, specified by the B<-server> and B<-partition>
arguments) in the Volume Location Database (VLDB) entry of the read/write
volume named by the B<-id> argument. When the B<vos release> command is
next issued against the read/write volume, a read-only copy of it is
distributed to all of the read-only sites, including the newly defined
one.

=head1 CAUTIONS

A volume's VLDB entry accommodates a maximum number of 16 site
definitions. The site housing the read/write and backup versions of the
volume counts as one site, the backup snapshot counts as one site, and one
site should be reserved for a transient clone for volume moves and similar
operations. Each read-only site counts as an additional site (even the
read-only site defined on the same file server machine and partition as
the read/write site counts as a separate site). The limit in the VLDB
entry effectively determines the maximum number of copies of the volume
that are available to AFS clients.

Attempts to create additional sites by using this command fail with an
error.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<machine name>>

Identifies the file server machine where the read-only volume is to
reside. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully
qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Identifies the partition where the read-only volume is to reside, on the
file server machine named by the B<-server> argument. Provide the
partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example, C</vicepa>)
or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated forms. For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-id> <I<volume name or ID>>

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of the read/write
source volume.

=item B<-roid> <I<readonly volume name or ID>>

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of the readonly
volume. This will only be honored if the source read/write volume does not
already have a readonly volume ID associated with it. If the source
read/write volume already has a readonly volume ID, the specified ID will
be ignored, and a warning will be printed.

If this is not specified and the source read/write volume does not already
have a readonly volume ID, a volume ID for the readonly volume will be
allocated for it when the B<vos release> command is run.

The automatically allocated readonly volume IDs should be fine for almost
all cases, so you should almost never need to specify them explicitly.
This option is available in OpenAFS versions 1.5.61 or later.

=item B<-valid>

Marks the site as up-to-date in the VLDB. You should only do this if the
new site already has a current readonly replica of the volume, but for
some reason it is not in the VLDB as a replica site. This is useful when
an existing read-only volume is dumped and restored with the B<-readonly>
flag at the new site. This option is available in OpenAFS clients 1.4.7 or
later and 1.5.31 or later. This option can be used with OpenAFS server
versions later than 1.4.1 or 1.5.0.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following example, appropriate in the Example Organization cell, defines a
read-only site for the cell's C<root.afs> volume.

   % vos addsite -server sv7.example.org -partition /vicepb -id root.afs

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
