=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<vos remsite> command removes the read-only replication site
specified by the B<-machine> and B<-partition> arguments from the Volume
Location Database (VLDB) entry for the indicated volume, which is
read/write.

This command is useful for removing read-only sites that were mistakenly
created with the B<vos addsite> command, before the B<vos release> command
actually releases them. If a read-only copy already exists at the site, it
is not affected. However, if this read-only site was the last site housing
any version of the volume, then the entire VLDB entry is removed, even if
a copy of the read-only version still actually exists at the site. The VL
Server does not correct the discrepancy until the B<vos syncserv> and
B<vos syncvldb> commands are run.

=head1 CAUTIONS

Do not use this command as the standard way to remove a read-only volume,
because it can create a discrepancy between the VLDB and the volumes on
file server machines. Use the B<vos remove> command instead.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-server> <I<server name>>

Specifies the file server machine portion of the site definition to
remove. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either fully
qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-partition> <I<partition name>>

Specifies the partition name portion of the site definition to
remove. Provide the partition's complete name with preceding slash (for
example, C</vicepa>) or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated
forms. For details, see L<vos(1)>.

=item B<-id> <I<volume name or id>>

Specifies either the complete name or volume ID number of the read/write
volume to remove.

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command removes the mistakenly defined read-only site
F</viceph> on the file server machine C<fs5.example.com> from the VLDB entry
for the volume C<root.cell>.

   % vos remsite -server fs5.example.com -partition h -id root.cell

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the F<{{ afsconfdir }}/UserList> file on the
machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each database server
machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included, the issuer must instead be
logged on to a server machine as the local superuser C<root>.
