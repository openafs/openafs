=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<xstat_fs_test> command tests the routines in the F<libxstat_fs.a>
library and displays the data collections associated with the File Server
(the C<fs> process). The command executes in the foreground.

The command produces a large volume of output; to save it for later
analysis, direct it to a file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item I<initcmd>

Accommodates the command's use of the AFS command parser, and is optional.

=item B<-fsname> <I<file server name to monitor>>+

Specifies the fully qualified hostname of each file server machine for
which to monitor the File Server process.

=item B<-collID> <I<collection to fetch>>+

Specifies each data collection to return, which defines the type and
amount of data the command interpreter gathers about the File Server.
Data is returned in a predefined data structure.

There are three acceptable values:

=over 4

=item 0

Provides profiling information about the numbers of times different
internal File Server routines were called since the File Server
started. This value is not currently implemented; it returns no data.

=item 1

Reports various internal performance statistics related to the File Server
(for example, vnode cache entries and Rx protocol activity).

=item 2

Reports all of the internal performance statistics provided by the C<1>
setting, plus some additional, detailed performance figures about the File
Server (for example, minimum, maximum, and cumulative statistics regarding
File Server RPCs, how long they take to complete, and how many succeed).

=back

=item B<-onceonly>

Gathers statistics just one time. Omit this flag to have the command
continue to probe the Cache Manager for statistics at the frequency
specified by the B<-frequency> argument; in this case press Ctrl-C to stop
the probes.

=item B<-frequency> <I<poll frequency>>

Sets the frequency in seconds at which the program initiates probes to the
Cache Manager. The default is 30 seconds.

=item B<-period> <I<data collection time>>

Sets the number of minutes the program runs; at the end of this period of
time, the program exits. The default is 10 minutes.

=item B<-debug>

Displays a trace on the standard output stream as the command runs.

=item B<-help>

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
