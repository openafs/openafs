=head1 DESCRIPTION

The vos restore command converts a volume dump file previously
created with the B<vos dump> command from ASCII into the volume format
appropriate for the machine type indicated by the B<-server> argument,
and restores it as a read/write volume to the partition named by the
B<-partition> argument on that machine. The Volume Server
assigns the volume name indicated with the B<-name> argument, and
resets the volume's creation timestamp to the time at which the restore
operation begins (the creation timestamp is stored in the volume header and
reported in the C<Creation> field in the output from the B<vos
examine> and B<vos listvol> commands.)

Use the -file argument to name the dump file, or omit the
argument to provide the file via the standard input stream, presumably through
a pipe. The pipe can be named, which enables interoperation with
third-party backup utilities.

As described in the following list, the command can create a completely new
volume or overwrite an existing volume. In all cases, the full dump of
the volume must be restored before any incremental dumps. If there are
multiple incremental dump files, they must be restored in the order they were
created.

=over 4

=item *

To create a new read/write volume, use the -name argument to
specify a volume name that does not already exist in the Volume Location
Database (VLDB), and the B<-server> and B<-partition>
arguments to specify the new volume's site. It is best to omit the
B<-id> argument so that the Volume Location (VL) Server allocates a
volume ID automatically. Do not include the B<-overwrite>
argument, because there is no existing volume to overwrite.


=item *

To overwrite an existing volume at its current site, specify its name and
site with the B<-name>, B<-server>, and B<-partition>
arguments. The volume retains its current volume ID number unless the
B<-id> argument is provided. Specify the value B<f> or
B<i> for the B<-overwrite> argument to indicate whether the
dump file is full or incremental, respectively.


=item *

To overwrite an existing volume and move it to a new site, specify its
name and the new site with the B<-name>, B<-server>, and
B<-partition> arguments. The volume retains its current volume
ID number unless the B<-id> argument is provided. The volume is
removed from its original site. Specify the value B<f> for the
B<-overwrite> argument to indicate that the dump file is a full dump
(it is not possible to restore an incremental dump and move the volume at the
same time).


=back

If the volume named by the -name argument already exists and the
B<-overwrite> argument is omitted, the command interpreter produces
the following prompt:

   Do you want to do a full/incremental restore or abort? [fia](a):

Respond by entering one of the following values:

=over 4

=item *

f if restoring a full dump file


=item *

i if restoring an incremental dump file


=item *

B<a> or <Return> to cancel the restore operation


=back

=head1 CAVEATS

If the -file argument is omitted, the issuer must provide all
other necessary arguments, because the standard input stream is unavailable
for responding to the command interpreter's prompts for missing
information. In particular, the issuer must provide the
B<-overwrite> argument if overwriting an existing volume.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -server

Identifies the file server machine onto which to restore the
volume. Provide the machine's IP address or its host name (either
fully qualified or using an unambiguous abbreviation). For details, see
the introductory reference page for the B<vos> command suite.

=item -partition

Identifies the partition (on the file server machine specified by the
B<-server> argument) onto which to restore the volume. Provide
the partition's complete name with preceding slash (for example,
B</vicepa>) or use one of the three acceptable abbreviated
forms. For details, see the introductory reference page for the
B<vos> command suite.

=item -name

Specifies the name under which to restore the volume. It can be up
to 22 characters long, but cannot end with a B<.readonly> or
B<.backup> extension. If the volume already exists, it
is overwritten subject to the value of the B<-overwrite>
argument.

=item -file

Names the dump file to restore. Incomplete pathnames are
interpreted relative to the current working directory. Omit this
argument to provide the dump file via the standard input stream.

=item -id

Specifies the volume ID number to assign to the restored volume.

=item -overwrite

Specifies which type of dump file is being restored when overwriting an
existing volume. Provide one of the following values:

=over 4

=item *

a to terminate the restore operation.


=item *

f if restoring a full dump file.


=item *

i if restoring an incremental dump file. This value is
not acceptable if the B<-server> and B<-partition> arguments
do not indicate the volume's current site.


=back

This argument is mandatory if the -file argument is not
provided.

=item -cell

Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the B<-localauth> flag. For more details, see the
introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -noauth

Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the B<-localauth>
flag. For more details, see the introductory B<vos> reference
page.

=item -localauth

Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
B</usr/afs/etc/KeyFile> file. The B<vos> command
interpreter presents it to the Volume Server and Volume Location Server during
mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
B<-cell> argument or B<-noauth> flag. For more details,
see the introductory B<vos> reference page.

=item -verbose

Produces on the standard output stream a detailed trace of the
command's execution. If this argument is omitted, only warnings
and error messages appear.

=item -help

Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following command restores the contents of the dump file
B</afs/abc.com/common/dumps/terry.dump> to the
B</vicepc> partition on the file server machine
B<fs3.abc.com>. The restored volume is named
B<user.terry>.

   % cd /afs/abc.com/common/dumps

   % vos restore -file terry.dump -server fs3.abc.com -partition c  \
                 -name user.terry
   

=head1 PRIVILEGE REQUIRED

The issuer must be listed in the /usr/afs/etc/UserList file on
the machine specified with the B<-server> argument and on each
database server machine. If the B<-localauth> flag is included,
the issuer must instead be logged on to a server machine as the local
superuser B<root>.
