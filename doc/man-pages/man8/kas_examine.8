.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBkas examine\fR command formats and displays information from the
Authentication Database entry of the user named by the \fB\-name\fR argument.
.PP
To alter the settings displayed with this command, issue the \fBkas
setfields\fR command.
.SH "CAUTIONS"
.IX Header "CAUTIONS"
Displaying actual keys on the standard output stream by including the
\&\fB\-showkey\fR flag constitutes a security exposure. For most purposes, it is
sufficient to display a checksum.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-name\fR <\fIname of user\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-name <name of user>"
Names the Authentication Database entry from which to display information.
.IP "\fB\-showkey\fR" 4
.IX Item "-showkey"
Displays the octal digits that constitute the key. The issuer must have
the \f(CW\*(C`ADMIN\*(C'\fR flag on his or her Authentication Database entry.
.IP "\fB\-admin_username\fR <\fIadmin principal\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-admin_username <admin principal>"
Specifies the user identity under which to authenticate with the
Authentication Server for execution of the command. For more details, see
\&\fIkas\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-password_for_admin\fR <\fIadmin password\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-password_for_admin <admin password>"
Specifies the password of the command's issuer. If it is omitted (as
recommended), the \fBkas\fR command interpreter prompts for it and does not
echo it visibly. For more details, see \fIkas\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-cell\fR <\fIcell name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-cell <cell name>"
Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see
\&\fIkas\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-servers\fR <\fIauthentication servers\fR>+" 4
.IX Item "-servers <authentication servers>+"
Names each machine running an Authentication Server with which to
establish a connection. For more details, see \fIkas\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-noauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noauth"
Assigns the unprivileged identity \f(CW\*(C`anonymous\*(C'\fR to the issuer. For more
details, see \fIkas\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are
ignored.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
The output includes:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The entry name, following the string \f(CW\*(C`User data for\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
One or more status flags in parentheses; they appear only if an
administrator has used the \fBkas setfields\fR command to change them from
their default values. A plus sign (\f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR) separates the flags if there is
more than one. The nondefault values that can appear, and their meanings,
are as follows:
.RS 4
.IP "\s-1ADMIN\s0" 4
.IX Item "ADMIN"
Enables the user to issue privileged \fBkas\fR commands (default is
\&\f(CW\*(C`NOADMIN\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\s-1NOTGS\s0" 4
.IX Item "NOTGS"
Prevents the user from obtaining tickets from the Authentication Server's
Ticket Granting Service (default is \f(CW\*(C`TGS\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\s-1NOSEAL\s0" 4
.IX Item "NOSEAL"
Prevents the Ticket Granting Service from using the entry's key field as
an encryption key (default is \f(CW\*(C`SEAL\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\s-1NOCPW\s0" 4
.IX Item "NOCPW"
Prevents the user from changing his or her password (default is \f(CW\*(C`CPW\*(C'\fR).
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\(bu" 4
The key version number, in parentheses, following the word \f(CW\*(C`key\*(C'\fR, then
one of the following.
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
A checksum equivalent of the key, following the string \f(CW\*(C`cksum is\*(C'\fR, if the
\&\fB\-showkey\fR flag is not included. The checksum is a decimal number derived
by encrypting a constant with the key. In the case of the \f(CW\*(C`afs\*(C'\fR entry,
this number must match the checksum with the corresponding key version
number in the output of the \fBbos listkeys\fR command; if not, follow the
instructions in the \fI\s-1IBM\s0 \s-1AFS\s0 Administration Guide\fR for creating a new
server encryption key.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The actual key, following a colon, if the \fB\-showkey\fR flag is
included. The key consists of eight octal numbers, each represented as a
backslash followed by three decimal digits.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\(bu" 4
The date the user last changed his or her own password, following the
string \f(CW\*(C`last cpw\*(C'\fR (which stands for \*(L"last change of password\*(R").
.IP "\(bu" 4
The string \f(CW\*(C`password will never expire\*(C'\fR indicates that the associated
password never expires; the string \f(CW\*(C`password will expire\*(C'\fR is followed by
the password's expiration date. After the indicated date, the user cannot
authenticate, but has 30 days after it in which to use the \fBkpasswd\fR or
\&\fBkas setpassword\fR command to set a new password. After 30 days, only an
administrator (one whose account is marked with the \f(CW\*(C`ADMIN\*(C'\fR flag) can
change the password by using the \fBkas setpassword\fR command. To set the
password expiration date, use the \fBkas setfields\fR command's \fB\-pwexpires\fR
argument.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The number of times the user can fail to provide the correct password
before the account locks, followed by the string \f(CW\*(C`consecutive
unsuccessful authentications are permitted\*(C'\fR, or the string \f(CW\*(C`An unlimited
number of unsuccessful authentications is permitted\*(C'\fR to indicate that
there is no limit. To set the limit, use the \fBkas setfields\fR command's
\&\fB\-attempts\fR argument. To unlock a locked account, use the \fBkas unlock\fR
command. The \fBkas setfields\fR reference page discusses how the
implementation of the lockout feature interacts with this setting.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The number of minutes for which the Authentication Server refuses the
user's login attempts after the limit on consecutive unsuccessful
authentication attempts is exceeded, following the string \f(CW\*(C`The lock time
for this user is\*(C'\fR. Use the \fBkas\fR command's \fB\-locktime\fR argument to set
the lockout time. This line appears only if a limit on the number of
unsuccessful authentication attempts has been set with the the \fBkas
setfields\fR command's \fB\-attempts\fR argument.
.IP "\(bu" 4
An indication of whether the Authentication Server is currently refusing
the user's login attempts. The string \f(CW\*(C`User is not locked\*(C'\fR indicates that
authentication can succeed, whereas the string \f(CW\*(C`User is locked until\*(C'\fR
\&\fItime\fR indicates that the user cannot authenticate until the indicated
time. Use the \fBkas unlock\fR command to enable a user to attempt
authentication. This line appears only if a limit on the number of
unsuccessful authentication attempts has been set with the \fBkas
setfields\fR command's \fB\-attempts\fR argument.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The date on which the Authentication Server entry expires, or the string
\&\f(CW\*(C`entry never expires\*(C'\fR to indicate that the entry does not expire. A user
becomes unable to authenticate when his or her entry expires. Use the
\&\fBkas setfields\fR command's \fB\-expiration\fR argument to set the expiration
date.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The maximum possible lifetime of the tokens that the Authentication Server
grants the user. This value interacts with several others to determine the
actual lifetime of the token, as described in \fIklog\fR\|(1).  Use the \fBkas
setfields\fR command's \fB\-lifetime\fR argument to set this value.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The date on which the entry was last modified, following the string \f(CW\*(C`last
mod on\*(C'\fR and the user name of the administrator who modified it. The date
on which a user changed his or her own password is recorded on the second
line of output as \f(CW\*(C`last cpw\*(C'\fR instead.
.IP "\(bu" 4
An indication of whether the user can reuse one of his or her last twenty
passwords when issuing the \fBkpasswd\fR, \fBkas setpassword\fR, or \fBkas
setkey\fR commands. Use the \fBkas setfields\fR command's \fB\-reuse\fR argument to
set this restriction.
