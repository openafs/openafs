.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The bos status command reports the status of processes on the
server machine named by the \fB\-server\fR argument, either
.IP "\(bu" 4
All of the \s-1AFS\s0 server processes listed in the
\&\fI/usr/afs/local/BosConfig\fR file
.IP "\(bu" 4
Only these processes named by the \-instance argument
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-server\fR <\fImachine name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-server <machine name>"
Indicates the server machine for which to report server process
status. Identify the machine by \s-1IP\s0 address or its host name (either
fully-qualified or abbreviated unambiguously). For details, see \fIbos\fR\|(8).
.IP "\-instance" 4
.IX Item "-instance"
Names each process for which to report status. Use the process name
assigned with the \fB\-instance\fR argument to the \fBbos\fR
command. The output from the \fBbos status\fR command lists the
names.
.IP "\-long" 4
.IX Item "-long"
Produces more detailed status information.
.IP "\fB\-cell\fR <\fIcell name\fR>" 4
.IX Item "-cell <cell name>"
Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the \fB\-localauth\fR flag. For more details, see \fIbos\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-noauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-noauth"
Assigns the unprivileged identity \f(CW\*(C`anonymous\*(C'\fR to the
issuer. Do not combine this flag with the \fB\-localauth\fR
flag. For more details, see \fIbos\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-localauth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-localauth"
Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
\&\fI/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile\fR file. The \fBbos\fR command
interpreter presents the ticket to the \s-1BOS\s0 Server during mutual
authentication. Do not combine this flag with the \fB\-cell\fR or
\&\fB\-noauth\fR options. For more details, see \fIbos\fR\|(8).
.IP "\fB\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-help"
Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
The output for a process includes at least one line, which reports one of
the following as the process's current status:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`currently running normally\*(C'\fR. The process's status
flag in the \fBBosConfig\fR file is \f(CW\*(C`Run\*(C'\fR. For
\&\fBcron\fR entries, this message indicates only that the command is
scheduled to run, not necessarily that it was executing when the \fBbos
status\fR command was issued.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`disabled\*(C'\fR. The process is not running, and its
\&\fBBosConfig\fR status flag is \f(CW\*(C`NotRun\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`temporarily disabled\*(C'\fR. The process is not running
although its status flag in the \fBBosConfig\fR file is
\&\f(CW\*(C`Run\*(C'\fR. Either an administrator used the \fBbos
shutdown\fR command to stop it, or the
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\s-1BOS\s0 Server stopped trying to restart it after numerous failed
attempts. In the second case, the auxiliary message is \f(CW\*(C`stopped for
too many errors\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`temporarily enabled\*(C'\fR. The process is running although its
status flag in the \fBBosConfig\fR file is \f(CW\*(C`NotRun\*(C'\fR. An
administrator has used the \fBbos startup\fR command to start it.
.PP
If one of the following special circumstances applies to the process, the
indicated message appears in its entry:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`has core file\*(C'\fR. The process failed and created a core
file in the \fI/usr/afs/logs\fR directory. If the \s-1BOS\s0 Server was
able to restart the process after the failure, the primary status is
\&\f(CW\*(C`currently running normally\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`stopped for too many  errors\*(C'\fR. The reason for the primary
status \f(CW\*(C`temporarily  disabled\*(C'\fR is that the \s-1BOS\s0 Server's attempts
to restart the process all failed.
.PP
The entry for the fs process always includes a second line to
report the process's \f(CW\*(C`Auxiliary status\*(C'\fR, which is one of the
following:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`file server running\*(C'\fR. The File Server and Volume Server
components of the File Server process are running normally.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW\*(C`salvaging file system\*(C'\fR. The Salvager is running, so the
File Server and Volume Server are temporarily disabled. The \s-1BOS\s0 Server
restarts them as soon as the Salvager is finished.
.PP
The entry for a cron process includes an \f(CW\*(C`Auxiliary
status\*(C'\fR that reports when the command will next execute.
.PP
If the \-long flag is used, each entry includes the following
additional information:
.IP "\(bu" 4
The process's type (\f(CW\*(C`simple\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`fs\*(C'\fR, or
\&\f(CW\*(C`cron\*(C'\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 4
The day and time the process last started or restarted.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The number of \f(CW\*(C`proc starts\*(C'\fR, which is how many times the \s-1BOS\s0
Server has started or restarted the process since it started itself.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`Last exit\*(C'\fR time when the process (or one of the component
processes in the \fBfs\fR process) last terminated. This line does
not appear if the process has not terminated since the \s-1BOS\s0 Server
started.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The \f(CW\*(C`Last error exit\*(C'\fR time when the process (or one of the
component processes in the \fBfs\fR process) last failed due to an
error. A further explanation such as \f(CW\*(C`due to shutdown request\*(C'\fR
sometimes appears. This line does not appear if the process has not
failed since the \s-1BOS\s0 Server started.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Each command that the \s-1BOS\s0 Server invokes to start the process, as
specified by the \fB\-cmd\fR argument to the \fBbos create\fR
command.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The pathname of the notifier program that the \s-1BOS\s0 Server invokes when the
process terminates (if any), as specified by the \fB\-notifier\fR argument
to the \fBbos create\fR command.
.PP
If the \-long flag is provided and the \s-1BOS\s0 Server discovers that
the mode bits on files and subdirectories in the local \fI/usr/afs\fR
directory differ from the expected values, it prints the following warning
message:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   Bosserver reports inappropriate access on server directories
.Ve
.PP
The following chart summarizes the expected mode bit settings. A
question mark indicates that the \s-1BOS\s0 Server does not check that bit.
