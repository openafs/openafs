<HR><H1><A NAME="HDRCOMMANDS" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_689">Appendix B. Using AFS Commands</A></H1>
<P>This section describes the components of AFS commands and
how to make entering commands more efficient by using shortened forms.
It has the following sections:
<DL>
<DD><P><A HREF="#HDRWQ613">AFS Command Syntax</A>
<DD><P><A HREF="#HDRWQ614">Rules for Entering AFS Commands</A>
<DD><P><A HREF="#HDRWQ615">Rules for Using Abbreviations and Aliases</A>

</DL>
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ613" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_690">AFS Command Syntax</A></H2>
<P>AFS commands that belong to suites have the following
structure:
<PRE>   <B>command_suite operation_code</B> <B>-switch</B> &lt;<VAR>value</VAR>><SUP>[+]</SUP>  [<B>-flag</B>]
   
</PRE>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_691" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_691">Command Names</A></H3>
<P>Together, the <B>command_suite</B> and <B>operation_code</B>
make up the <I>command name</I>.
<P>The <B>command_suite</B> specifies the group of related commands to
which the command belongs, and indicates which command interpreter and server
process perform the command. AFS has several command suites, including
<B>bos</B>, <B>fs</B>, <B>kas</B>, <B>package</B>,
<B>pts</B>, <B>scout</B>, <B>uss</B> and <B>vos</B>.
Some of these suites have an interactive mode in which the issuer omits the
<B>command_suite</B> portion of the command name.
<P>The <B>operation_code</B> tells the command interpreter and server
process which action to perform. Most command suites include several
operation codes. The <I>IBM AFS Administration Reference</I>
describes each operation code in detail, and the <I>IBM AFS Administration
Guide</I> describes how to use them in the context of performing
administrative tasks.
<P>Several AFS commands do not belong to a suite and so their names do not
have a <B>command_suite</B> portion. Their structure is otherwise
similar to the commands in the suites.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_692" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_692">Options</A></H3>
<P>The term <I>option</I> refers to both arguments and flags, which
are described in the following sections.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_693" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_693">Arguments</A></H3>
<P>One or more arguments can follow the command name. Arguments
specify the entities on which to act while performing the command (for
example, which server machine, server process, or file). To minimize
the potential for error, provide a command's arguments in the order
prescribed in its syntax definition.
<P>Each argument has two parts, which appear in the indicated order:
<UL>
<P><LI>The <I>switch</I> specifies the argument's type and is preceded
by a hyphen ( <B>-</B> ). For instance, the switch
<B>-server</B> usually indicates that the argument names a server
machine. Switches can often be omitted, subject to the rules outlined
in <A HREF="#HDRNOSWITCH">Conditions for Omitting Switches</A>.
<P><LI>The <I>value</I> names a particular entity of the type specified by
the preceding switch. For example, the proper value for a
<B>-server</B> switch is a server machine name like
<B>fs3.abc.com</B>. Unlike switches (which have a
required form), values vary depending on what the issuer wants to
accomplish. Values appear surrounded by angle brackets (<B>&lt;
></B>) in command descriptions and the online help to show that they are
user-supplied variable information.
</UL>
<P>Some arguments accept multiple values, as indicated by trailing plus sign (
<B>+</B> ) in the command descriptions and online help. How many of
a command's arguments take multiple values, and their ordering with
respect to other arguments, determine when it is acceptable to omit
switches. See <A HREF="#HDRNOSWITCH">Conditions for Omitting Switches</A>.
<P>Some commands have optional as well as required arguments; the command
descriptions and online help show optional arguments in square brackets ([
]).
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_694" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_694">Flags</A></H3>
<P>Some commands have one or more flags, which specify the manner in which
the command interpreter and server process perform the command, or what kind
of output it produces. Flags are preceded by hyphens like switches, but
they take no values. Although the command descriptions and online help
generally list a command's flags after its arguments, there is no
prescribed order for flags. They can appear anywhere on the command
line following the operation code, except in between the parts of an
argument. Flags are always optional.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRCOMMAND-EX" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_695">An Example Command</A></H3>
<P>The following example illustrates the different parts
of a command that belongs to an AFS command suite.
<PRE>   % <B>bos getdate -server fs1.abc.com -file ptserver kaserver </B>
   
</PRE>
<P>where
<UL>
<P><LI><B>bos</B> is the command suite. The BOS Server executes most
of the commands in this suite.
<P><LI><B>getdate</B> is the operation code. It tells the BOS Server
on the specified server machine (in this case
<B>fs1.abc.com</B>) to report the modification dates of
binary files in the local <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory.
<P><LI><B>-server fs1.abc.com</B> is one argument, with
<B>-server</B> as the switch and <B>fs1.abc.com</B> as
the value. This argument specifies the server machine on which BOS
Server is to collect and report binary dates.
<P><LI><B>-file ptserver kaserver</B> is an argument that takes multiple
values. The switch is <B>-file</B> and the values are
<B>ptserver</B> and <B>kaserver</B>. This argument tells the
BOS Server to report the modification dates on the files
<B>/usr/afs/bin/kaserver</B> and <B>/usr/afs/bin/ptserver</B>.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ614" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_696">Rules for Entering AFS Commands</A></H3>
<P>Enter each AFS command on a single line (press
<B>&lt;Return></B> only at the end of the command). Some commands
in this document appear broken across multiple lines, but that is for
legibility only.
<P>Use a space to separate each element on a command line from its
neighbors. Spaces rather than commas also separate multiple values of
an argument.
<P>In many cases, the issuer of a command can reduce the amount of typing
necessary by using one or both of the following methods:
<UL>
<P><LI>Omitting switches
<P><LI>Using accepted abbreviations for operation codes, switches (if they are
included at all), and some types of values
</UL>
<P>The following sections explain the conditions for omitting or shortening
parts of the command line. It is always acceptable to type a command in
full, with all of its switches and no abbreviations.
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRNOSWITCH">Conditions for Omitting Switches</A></H4>
<P>It is always acceptable to type the switch part of an
argument, but in many cases it is not necessary. Specifically, switches
can be omitted if the following conditions are met.
<UL>
<P><LI>All of the command's required arguments appear in the order
prescribed by the syntax statement
<P><LI>No switch is provided for any argument
<P><LI>There is only one value for each argument (but note the important
exception discussed in the following paragraph)
</UL>
<P>Omitting switches is possible only because there is a prescribed order for
each command's arguments. When the issuer does not include
switches, the command interpreter relies instead on the order of
arguments; it assumes that the first element after the operation code is
the command's first argument, the next element is the command's
second argument, and so on. The important exception is when a
command's final required argument accepts multiple values. In this
case, the command interpreter assumes that the issuer has correctly provided
one value for each argument up through the final one, so any additional values
at the end belong to the final argument.
<P>The following list describes the rules for omitting switches from the
opposite perspective: an argument's switch must be provided when
any of the following conditions apply.
<UL>
<P><LI>The command's arguments do not appear in the prescribed order
<P><LI>An optional argument is omitted but a subsequent optional argument is
provided
<P><LI>A switch is provided for a preceding argument
<P><LI>More than one value is supplied for a preceding argument (which must take
multiple values, of course); without a switch on the current argument,
the command interpreter assumes that the current argument is another value for
the preceding argument
</UL>
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_698">An Example of Omitting Switches</A></H4>
<P>Consider again the example command from <A HREF="#HDRCOMMAND-EX">An Example Command</A>.
<PRE>   % <B> bos getdate -server fs1.abc.com -file ptserver kaserver</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>This command has two required arguments: the server machine name
(identified by the <B>-server</B> switch) and binary file name (identified
by the <B>-file</B> switch). The second argument accepts multiple
values. By complying with all three conditions, the issuer can omit the
switches:
<PRE>   % <B>bos getdate fs1.abc.com ptserver kaserver</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>Because there are no switches, the <B>bos</B> command interpreter
relies on the order of arguments. It assumes that the first element
following the operation code, <B>fs1.abc.com</B>, is the
server machine name, and that the next argument, <B>ptserver</B>, is a
binary file name. Then, because the command's second (and last)
argument accepts multiple values, the command interpreter correctly interprets
<B>kaserver</B> as an additional value for it.
<P>On the other hand, the following is not acceptable because it violates the
first two conditions in <A HREF="#HDRNOSWITCH">Conditions for Omitting Switches</A>: even though there is only one value per argument, the
arguments do not appear in the prescribed order, and a switch is provided for
one argument but not the other.
<PRE>   % <B>bos getdate ptserver -server fs1.abc.com</B>
   
</PRE>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ615" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_699">Rules for Using Abbreviations and Aliases</A></H3>
<P>This section explains how to abbreviate operation codes,
option names, server machine names, partition names, and cell names. It
is not possible to abbreviate other types of values.
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_700">Abbreviating Operation Codes</A></H4>
<P>It is acceptable to abbreviate an operation code to the shortest form
that still distinguishes it from the other operation codes in its
suite.
<P>For example, it is acceptable to shorten <B>bos install</B> to <B>bos
i</B> because there are no other operation codes in the <B>bos</B>
command suite that begin with the letter <B>i</B>. In contrast,
there are several <B>bos</B> operation codes that start with the letter
<B>s</B>, so the abbreviations must be longer to remain unambiguous:
<DL>
<DD><P><B>bos sa</B> for <B>bos salvage</B>
<DD><P><B>bos seta</B> for <B>bos setauth</B>
<DD><P><B>bos setc</B> for <B>bos setcellname</B>
<DD><P><B>bos setr</B> for <B>bos setrestart</B>
<DD><P><B>bos sh</B> for <B>bos shutdown</B>
<DD><P><B>bos start</B> for <B>bos start</B>
<DD><P><B>bos startu</B> for <B>bos startup</B>
<DD><P><B>bos stat</B> for <B>bos status</B>
<DD><P><B>bos sto</B> for <B>bos stop</B>
</DL>
<P>In addition to abbreviations, some operation codes have an
<I>alias</I>, a short form that is not derived by abbreviating the
operation code to its shortest unambiguous form. For example, the alias
for the <B>fs setacl</B> command is <B>fs sa</B>, whereas the shortest
unambiguous abbreviation is <B>fs seta</B>.
<P>There are two usual reasons an operation code has an alias:
<UL>
<P><LI>Because the command is frequently issued, it is convenient to have a form
shorter than the one derived by abbreviating. The <B>fs setacl</B>
command is an example.
<P><LI>Because the command's name has changed, but users of previous
versions of AFS know the former name. For example, <B>bos
listhosts</B> has the alias <B>bos getcell</B>, its former name.
It is acceptable to abbreviate aliases to their shortest unambiguous form (for
example, <B>bos getcell</B> to <B>bos getc</B>).
</UL>
<P>Even if an operation code has an alias, it is still acceptable to use the
shortest unambiguous form. Thus, the <B>fs setacl</B> command has
three acceptable forms: <B>fs setacl</B> (the full form), <B>fs
seta</B> (the shortest abbreviation), and <B>fs sa</B> (the
alias).
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_701">Abbreviating Switches and Flags</A></H4>
<P>It is acceptable to shorten a switch or flag to the shortest form that
distinguishes it from the other switches and flags for its operation
code. It is often possible to omit switches entirely, subject to the
conditions listed in <A HREF="#HDRNOSWITCH">Conditions for Omitting Switches</A>.
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRFMSABBREV">Abbreviating Server Machine Names</A></H4>
<P>AFS server machines must have fully-qualified
Internet-style host names (for example, <B>fs1.abc.com</B>),
but it is not always necessary to type the full name on the command
line. AFS commands accept unambiguous shortened forms, but depend on
the cell's name service (such as the Domain Name Service) or a local host
table to resolve a shortened name to the fully-qualified equivalent when the
command is issued.
<P>Most commands also accept the dotted decimal form of the machine's IP
address as an identifier.
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRPARTABBREV">Abbreviating Partition Names</A></H4>
<P>Partitions that house AFS volumes must have names of
the form <B>/vicep</B><VAR>x</VAR> or <B>/vicep</B><VAR>xx</VAR>, where
the variable final portion is one or two lowercase letters. By
convention, the first server partition created on a file server machine is
called <B>/vicepa</B>, the second <B>/vicepb</B>, and so on.
The <I>IBM AFS Quick Beginnings</I> explains how to configure and name a
file server machine's partitions in preparation for storing AFS volumes
on them.
<P>When issuing AFS commands, you can abbreviate a partition name using any of
the following forms:
<PRE>   <B>/vicepa</B>     =     <B>vicepa</B>      =      <B>a</B>      =      <B>0</B>
   <B>/vicepb</B>     =     <B>vicepb</B>      =      <B>b</B>      =      <B>1</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>After <B>/vicepz</B> (for which the index is 25) comes
<PRE>   <B>/vicepaa</B>    =     <B>vicepaa</B>     =      <B>aa</B>     =      <B>26</B>
   <B>/vicepab</B>    =     <B>vicepab</B>     =      <B>ab</B>     =      <B>27</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>and so on through
<PRE>   <B>/vicepiv</B>    =     <B>vicepiv</B>     =      <B>iv</B>     =      <B>255</B>
    
</PRE>
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRCELLABBREV">Abbreviating Cell Names</A></H4>
<P>A cell's full name usually matches its Internet
domain name (such as <B>stateu.edu</B> for the State University or
<B>abc.com</B> for ABC Corporation). Some AFS commands
accept unambiguous shortened forms, usually with respect to the local
<B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB file</B> but sometimes depending on the
ability of the local name service to resolve the corresponding domain
name.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ616" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_705">Displaying Online Help for AFS Commands</A></H3>
<P>To display online help for AFS commands that belong to
suites, use the <B>help</B> and <B>apropos</B> operation codes.
A <B>-help</B> flag is also available on every almost every AFS
command.
<P>The online help entry for a command consists of two or three lines:
<UL>
<P><LI>The first line names the command and briefly describes what it does
<P><LI>If the command has aliases, they appear on the next line
<P><LI>The final line, which begins with the string <TT>Usage:</TT>,
lists the command's options in the prescribed order; online help
entries use the same typographical symbols (brackets and so on) as this
documentation.
</UL>
<P>If no operation code is specified, the <B>help</B> operation code
displays the first line (short description) for every operation code in the
suite:
<PRE>   
   % <VAR>command_suite</VAR>  <B>help</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>If the issuer specifies one or more operation codes, the <B>help</B>
operation code displays each command's complete online entry (short
description, alias if any, and syntax):
<PRE>   
   % <VAR>command_suite</VAR> <B>help</B> <VAR>operation_code</VAR><SUP>+</SUP>
   
</PRE>
<P>The <B>-help</B> flag displays a command's syntax but not the
short description or alias:
<PRE>   % <VAR>command_name</VAR> <B>-help</B>  
   
</PRE>
<P>The <B>apropos</B> operation code displays the short description of any
command in a suite whose operation code or short description includes the
specified keyword:
<PRE>   % <VAR>command_suite</VAR> <B>apropos</B> <VAR>"&lt;help&nbsp;string>"</VAR>
   
</PRE>
<P>The following example command displays the complete online help entry for
the <B>fs setacl</B> command:
<PRE>   
   % <B>fs help setacl </B>  
   fs setacl: set access control list
   aliases: sa
   Usage: fs setacl -dir &lt;directory>+ -acl &lt;access list entries>+ 
   [-clear] [-negative] [-id] [-if] [-help]
   
</PRE>
<P>To see only the syntax statement, use the <B>-help</B> flag:
<PRE>   % <B>fs setacl -help</B>
   Usage: fs setacl -dir &lt;directory>+ -acl &lt;access list entries>+ 
   [-clear] [-negative] [-id] [-if] [-help]
   
</PRE>
<P>In the following example, a user wants to display the quota for her home
volume. She knows that the relevant command belongs to the
<B>fs</B> suite, but cannot remember the operation code. She uses
<B>quota</B> as the keyword:
<PRE>   
   % <B>fs apropos quota</B>
   listquota: list volume quota
   quota: show volume quota usage
   setquota: set volume quota
   
</PRE>
<P>The following illustrates the error message that results if no command name
or short description contains the keyword:
<PRE>   
   % <B>fs apropos "list quota"</B>
   Sorry, no commands found
