<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ422" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_493">Using the package Program</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX7523"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7524"></A>
<P>The <B>package</B> program uses system-independent <I>prototype
files</I> to define a standard disk configuration; a prototype file
indicates which files reside on the local client disk, which files are links
into AFS, etc. The prototype files are then compiled into
<I>configuration files</I> for each different system type.
<P>Not all client machines have the same configuration. If desired, you
can create different prototype files for different client functions (print
server, regular client, etc.).
<P>The <B>package</B> program compares the contents of a local client disk
with the configuration file. If there are any differences, the
<B>package</B> program makes the necessary updates to the local disk by
copying the files from AFS onto the disk. The <B>package</B>
program can also be configured to delete files that are not part of the system
configuration or automatically reboot the client when certain files (such as
the <B>dkload</B> file) have been updated.
<P>The <B>package</B> program does require that you take some time to
prepare the prototype files, but it provides the following benefits:
<UL>
<P><LI>You no longer need to configure each machine individually; the
prototype configuration file applies to all machines.
<P><LI>You can change the configuration of machines simply by changing the
prototype file and rebooting the clients.
<P><LI>Disk organization is uniform across a set of machines.
<P><LI>The configuration files serve as a record of files on the disk and
symbolic links into AFS.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_494" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_494">Using Package on File Server Machines</A></H3>
<P>While the <B>package</B> program was designed for use on client
machines, it can also be used to configure a file server machine's
disk. However, if any of the files referred to in a configuration file
reside in volumes on the file server, the <B>package</B> program cannot
access the volumes during reboot (and until the File Server process and Volume
Server process start up again).
<P>Since the <B>package</B> program aborts when it cannot access a file,
you need to eliminate references to files in AFS that reside in volumes on the
file server machine. Because of these constraints, the remainder of
this chapter assumes the <B>package</B> program is being used for client
configurations.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ423" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_495">Package Overview</A></H2>
<P>There are three main steps to follow before running the
<B>package</B> program: 
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Preparing function-specific <I>prototype files</I> (and any included
<I>library files</I>).
<P><LI>Modifying the <B>package</B> <B>Makefile</B> and compiling
prototype files into system-specific <I>configuration files</I>.
<P><LI>Modifying client machines to run the appropriate <B>package</B>
configuration file automatically.
</OL>
<P>The following sections summarize these steps.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_496" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_496">Preparing Prototype Files</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7526"></A>
<P>Begin by listing the different functions or roles client machines perform
and the local disk configurations that support those functions. Example
roles include a standard client that provides AFS access, a print server that
drives a printer, and a backup machine on which you issue commands from the
<B>backup</B> suite. Create a different <I>prototype file</I>
for each role.
<P>A prototype file defines the disk configuration that supports a specific
role. Usually, prototype files are function-specific, but system
independent; system-specific values can be defined using variables and
library files. Then, when you modify a variable or library file, the
change gets propagated to all appropriate clients when the <B>package</B>
program is invoked.
<P>Methods for building flexible prototype files that are easy to maintain are
presented in <A HREF="#HDRWQ427">Example Prototype and Library Files</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ424" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_497">Compiling Prototype Files</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7527"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7528"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7529"></A>
<P>Prototype files are usually system-independent, but can include
<TT>ifdef</TT> statements to satisfy the needs of different system
types. The prototype files are compiled to generate operating-system
specific versions. During compilation, the <B>package</B> program
selects the definitions suitable for each system type and replaces any
variables with actual values. These compiled, machine-specific files
are called <I>configuration files</I>.
<P>Prototype files are compiled using a standard-type <B>Makefile</B>
file, as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ438">The Package Makefile File</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_498" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_498">Preparing Clients</A></H3>
<P>Once system-specific configuration files exist, the <B>package</B>
program is ready to run on the clients. You must first make the
<B>package</B> binary available and specify the correct configuration
file.
<P>Modify the clients as described below:
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Create a <B>.package</B> file in the root ( <B>/</B> )
directory of each client's local disk that defines the default
configuration file.
<P><LI>Make the <B>package</B> binary (<B>/etc/package</B>) available on
the local disk.
<P><LI>Modify the machine's initialization file (<B>/etc/rc</B> or
equivalent) to include a call to the <B>package</B> program.
</OL>
<P>These steps are discussed more completely in <A HREF="#HDRWQ447">Modifying Client Machines</A>.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ425" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_499">The package Directory Structure</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX7530"></A>
<P>This section assumes that the <B>package</B>-related files have been
installed in three subdirectories of the
<B>/afs/</B><VAR>cellname</VAR>/<B>wsadmin</B> directory:
<B>src</B>, <B>lib</B> and <B>etc</B>, as recommended in the
<I>IBM AFS Quick Beginnings</I>.
<P>These directories contain several sample prototype, library, and
configuration files, which can help to clarify how the <B>package</B>
program works. However, they are not necessarily suitable for use in
your cell; you must modify them for your needs.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ426" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_500">The src directory</A></H3>
<P>The <B>src</B> directory contains some sample prototype
files (used to build the configuration files), the <B>Makefile</B> file
used to build them, and the resulting compiled configuration files.
<P>Prototype files have names of the form
<VAR>function</VAR>.<B>proto</B>. For example, a
<B>minimal.proto</B> file defines the minimum set of library files
need to run AFS and a<B>staff.dkload.proto</B> file defines
a client configuration that uses the a dynamic kernel loading program.
Prototype files can also contain definitions for system administrative files,
such as a <B>hosts.equiv</B> file.
<P>The <B>Makefile</B> file is used to compile the system-independent
prototype files into system-specific configuration files. To learn how
to modify this file for use in your cell, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ438">The Package Makefile File</A>.
<P>Configuration files are the compiled version of the prototype files and are
named <VAR>function</VAR><B>.</B><VAR>sysname</VAR>.
Configuration files also appear in the <B>etc</B> subdirectory, which the
<B>package</B> program accesses when configuring disks.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_501" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_501">The lib directory</A></H3>
<P>The <B>lib</B> directory contains many of the example library files
referred to in prototype files. For example, the
<B>base.generic</B> file is a system-independent file which
includes a definition of the cell name, system options, and variables;
these are used to set the <VAR>owner</VAR>, <VAR>group</VAR>, and
<VAR>mode_bits</VAR> fields in the file and the symbolic link
definitions.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_502" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_502">The etc directory</A></H3>
<P>The <B>etc</B> directory contains the system-specific configuration
files built from the prototype files in the <B>src</B>
subdirectory. The <B>package</B> program uses the configuration
files in the <B>etc</B> directory to configure disks.
<P>Some of the example files include <B>minimal</B> and <B>staff</B>
prototype files compiled for different system types.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ427" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_503">Example Prototype and Library Files</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX7531"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7532"></A>
<P>A prototype file is a template that defines the configuration of a
client's local disk. Prototype files are usually function-specific
(for example, a backup machine, print server, etc.) but
system-independent. Prototype files support the use of <TT>ifdef</TT>
statements and variables, so you can include system-specific
definitions. The actual system-specific configuration file is generated
when the prototype file is compiled.
<P>The components defined in a prototype file can include the directories,
files, symbolic links, block special devices, character special devices and
sockets that need to reside on a client's local disk in order for it to
perform a specific role, such as a print server or backup machine.
Thus, we recommend that you construct a unique prototype file for each
different client function.
<P>To make the <B>package</B> program more effective and easy to maintain,
create prototype files that are modular and generic, instead of specific, by
using library files and variables:
<A NAME="IDX7533"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7534"></A>
<UL>
<P><LI>By creating general-purpose library files, you can include the same
library file in many prototype files. Thus, you can make global
configuration changes by modifying a single library file; you do not need
to modify each prototype file.
<P><LI>Variables enable you to change definitions simply by changing the
variable's value.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ428" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_504">An Example Prototype File</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7535"></A>
<P>The following is part of an example prototype file that contains the
minimum definitions necessary to run AFS. A similar file called
<B>minimal.proto</B> can reside in your <B>src</B>
subdirectory. As recommended, this prototype file references library
files and does not include actual definitions.
<PRE>            .
            .
   # Package prototype for a minimal configuration.
   # Base components
   %include ${wsadmin}/lib/base.generic
   # Machine-specific components
   %ifdef rs_aix42

   %endif sun4x_56
            .
            .
</PRE>
<P>In the previous example, the first uncommented line includes the
<B>/lib/base.generic</B> library file. This library file can
contain definitions appropriate for many prototype files; the
<B>base.generic</B> library file can also be included in other
prototype files, like a <B>staff.proto</B> or
<B>backup.proto</B> file. An example library file appears in
the following section.
<P>Note that system-specific definitions are permitted through the use of
<TT>ifdef</TT> statements and variables (for example, <TT>${wsadmin}</TT>
is used to specify pathnames). Thus, the same prototype file can be
used to configure a machine running AIX 4.2 or Solaris 2.6, even
though they require different files, directories, symbolic links and
devices.
<P>In the next uncommented lines of this example, the administrator has
constructed different library files for different system types. Each of
these is compiled into unique configuration files. For instance, the
following lines in this prototype file tell the <B>package</B> program to
use the library files <B>lib/rs_aix42.readonly</B> and
<B>lib/rs_aix42.AFS</B> for the configuration file when the value
<TT>rs_aix42</TT> has been declared. (The system-type definition is
declared in the <B>Makefile</B>; see <A HREF="#HDRWQ438">The Package Makefile File</A>.)
<PRE>   %ifdef rs_aix42
   %include ${wsadmin}/lib/rs_aix42.readonly
   %include ${wsadmin}/lib/rs_aix42.AFS
   %endif rs_aix42
</PRE>
<P>Similarly, the following lines tell the <B>package</B> program to use
the library files <B>lib/sun4x_56.readonly</B> and
<B>lib/sun4x_56.AFS</B> when the value <TT>sun4x_56</TT> has been
declared.
<PRE>   %ifdef sun4x_56
   %include ${wsadmin}/lib/sun4x_56.readonly
   %include ${wsadmin}/lib/sun4x_56.AFS
   %endif sun4x_56

disk configuration. The proper syntax for these instructions is briefly
described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ429">Package Configuration File Instruction Syntax</A>; see the reference page for the <B>package</B>
configuration file in the <I>IBM AFS Administration Reference</I> for

<P>Within a library file, configuration file instructions are used to define
the specific disk configuration. Each instruction can be used to define
a file, directory, socket, or device on the client machine. The syntax

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ430" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_507">Local Files versus Symbolic Links</A></H3>
<P>You can take advantage of the AFS by keeping the number of
files on the local client disk to a minimum; instead, create symbolic
links that point into AFS. This can improve machine performance by
allowing more space for caching and swapping.
<P>Some files, however, must reside on the local disk, as described
below. Create these files in the prototype or library files using the
<B>F</B> (file) instruction, not the <B>L</B> (symbolic link)
instruction.
<P>The following types of files must reside on the local disk of all AFS
clients:
<UL>
<P><LI>Boot sequence files executed before the <B>afsd</B> program
runs. 
<P>Until <B>afsd</B> runs and initializes the Cache Manager, AFS is
inaccessible from the client. Any files that are executed before the
<B>afsd</B> program runs must reside on the local client disk.
<P>For example, on a machine that uses a disk cache, the
<B>/usr/vice/cache</B> directory must exist when you bring up the Cache
Manager, so that there is a location to create cache files. The binary
files <B>/etc/mount</B> and <B>/etc/umount</B> must be available on
the local disk as the machine boots in order to mount the
<B>/usr/vice/cache</B> directory.
<P>In addition, certain UNIX files, such as initialization files
(<B>/etc/rc</B> or equivalent) and file system mapping files
(<B>/etc/fstab</B> or equivalent), must reside on the local disk.
<P><LI>Diagnostic and recovery files 
<P>Certain commands can be used to diagnose and recover from problems caused
by a file server outage. It is best to keep copies of the binaries for
these commands on the local disk. For example, store the <B>bos</B>
and <B>fs</B> binaries in the <B>/usr/vice/etc</B> directory on the
local disk, as well as in the <B>/usr/afsws</B> directory (which in the
conventional configuration is a symbolic link into AFS). Then, set PATH
variables so that the <B>/usr/afsws</B> directory appears before the
<B>/usr/vice/etc</B> directory. Thus, even if users cannot access
AFS (for example, due to a file server outage) they can still access copies of
the <B>bos</B> and <B>fs</B> binaries in the <B>/usr/vice/etc</B>
directory on the local disk.
<P><LI>Files in the <B>/usr/vice</B> directory 
<P>The contents of the <B>/usr/vice</B> directory, including the cache
files in the <B>cache</B> subdirectory and the configuration files in the
<B>etc</B> subdirectory, must reside on the local disk. For a
description of the files in the directory, see <A HREF="auagd015.htm#HDRWQ391">Configuration and Cache-Related Files on the Local Disk</A>.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ448" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_532">Running the package program</A></H2>
<P>After you have created and compiled prototype files and
modified client machines, you are ready to run the <B>package</B>
program. It is probably most convenient to run the <B>package</B>
program automatically at reboot by invoking it in the machine's AFS
initialization file, but you can also issue the command at the command shell
prompt.
<P>The configuration file must be completely correct. If there are any
syntax errors or incorrect values, the program exits without executing any
instruction. To check the configuration file, issue the
<B>package</B> command with the <B>-noaction</B> and <B>-debug</B>
flags at the command shell prompt. They display a list of potential
problems without actually executing instructions.
<P>The <B>package</B> program follows these general rules. Complete
explanations are in <A HREF="#HDRWQ429">Package Configuration File Instruction Syntax</A>.
<UL>
<P><LI>The <B>package</B> program does not delete any files from the disk
unless the <B>R</B> update code was specified in the prototype
file. If the <B>R</B> update code is associated with the parent
directory, the <B>package</B> program removes anything from the local disk
directory that is not specified in the configuration file.
<P><LI>Local files are updated only if they are out of date. For each
<B>F</B> instruction in the configuration file, the <B>package</B>
program compares the time of the local file with the indicated source
file. If the source file is newer than the local, the file is
updated.
<P><LI>When the initialization file is modified as recommended in <A HREF="#HDRWQ447">Modifying Client Machines</A>, the <B>package</B> program reboots the workstation
automatically if any files marked with the <B>Q</B> update code are
updated, and if the <B>package</B> program has been invoked from the
initialization file. When a file marked with the <B>Q</B> update
code is changed, the <B>package</B> program exits with status code 4,
causing a reboot (as directed in the initialization file). Files that
require a reboot before changes are recognized (such as the operating system
kernel and <B>/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB</B> files) must be marked with a
<B>Q</B> update code in the configuration file.
<P><LI>The <B>package</B> program copies the configuration file it has just
used to <B>/etc/package.</B><VAR>sysname</VAR>, where
<VAR>sysname</VAR> reflects this machine's system type. The
<B>package</B> command interpreter consults this file if you do not
provide a configuration file name. To be sure that it configures the
local disk as you wish, review its contents.

overwritten; see the definition for the <B>F</B> instruction.
<P><DT><B>-noaction
</B><DD>Displays on the standard output stream a trace of potential problems in
running the command, rather than actually running it. If the

list of problems encountered while executing the command.
<P><DT><B>-verbose

setting of each element in the configuration file.
<P><DT><B>-rebootfiles
</B><DD>Prevents the overwrite of any element marked with the <B>Q</B>
update-mode code in the configuration file. This effectively prevents
the machine from rebooting automatically again when the <B>package</B>

reboot the machine. This reboot does not occur automatically.
