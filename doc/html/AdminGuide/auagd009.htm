<A NAME="IDX6247"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6248"></A>
<P>One of your most important responsibilities as a system administrator is
ensuring that the processes on file server machines are running
correctly. The BOS Server, which runs on every file server machine,
relieves you of much of the responsibility by constantly monitoring the other
AFS server processes on its machine. It can automatically restart
processes that have failed, ordering the restarts to take interdependencies
into account.
<P>Because different file server machines run different combinations of
processes, you must define which processes the BOS Server on each file server
machine is to monitor (to learn how, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ154">Controlling and Checking Process Status</A>).
<P>It is sometimes necessary to take direct control of server process status
before performing routine maintenance or correcting problems that the BOS
Server cannot correct (such as problems with database replication or mutual
authentication). At those times, you control process status through the
BOS Server by issuing <B>bos</B> commands.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ145" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_166">Brief Descriptions of the AFS Server Processes</A></H2>
<P>This section briefly describes the different server
processes that can run on an AFS server machine. In cells with multiple
server machines, not all processes necessarily run on all machines.
<P>An AFS server process is referred to in one of three ways, depending on the
context:
<A NAME="IDX6249"></A>
<UL>
<P><LI>The output from the <B>bos status</B> command refers to a process by
the name assigned when the <B>bos create</B> command creates its entry in
the <B>/usr/afs/local/BosConfig</B> file. The name can differ from
machine to machine, but it is easiest to maintain the cell if you assign the
same name on all machines. The <I>IBM AFS Quick Beginnings</I> and
the reference page for the <B>bos create</B> command list the conventional
names. Examples are <B>bosserver</B>, <B>kaserver</B>, and
<B>vlserver</B>.
<P><LI>The process listing produced by the standard <B>ps</B> command
generally matches the process's binary file. Examples of process
binary files are <B>/usr/afs/bin/bosserver</B>,
<B>/usr/afs/bin/kaserver</B>, and <B>/usr/afs/bin/vlserver</B>.
<P><LI>In most contexts, including most references in the documentation, a
process is referred to as (for example) the <B>Basic OverSeer (BOS)
Server</B>, the <B>Authentication Server</B>, or the <B>Volume
Location Server</B>.
</UL>
<P>The following sections specify each name for the process as well as some of
the administrative tasks in which you use the process. For a more
general description of the servers, see <A HREF="auagd006.htm#HDRWQ17">AFS Server Processes and the Cache Manager</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ146" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_167">The bosserver Process: the Basic OverSeer Server</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX6250"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6251"></A>
<P>The <B>bosserver</B> process, which runs on every AFS server machine,
is the Basic OverSeer (BOS) Server responsible for monitoring the other AFS
server processes running on its machine. If a process fails, the BOS
Server can restart it automatically, without human intervention. It
takes interdependencies into account when restarting a process that has
multiple component processes (such as the <B>fs</B> process described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ148">The fs Collection of Processes: the File Server, Volume Server and Salvager</A>).
<A NAME="IDX6252"></A>
<P>Because the BOS Server does not monitor or restart itself, it does not
appear in the output from the <B>bos status</B> command. It appears
in the <B>ps</B> command's output as
<TT>/usr/afs/bin/bosserver</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX6253"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6254"></A>
<P>As a system administrator, you contact the BOS Server when you issue
<B>bos</B> commands to perform the following kinds of tasks.
<A NAME="IDX6255"></A>
<UL>
<P><LI>Defining the processes for the BOS Server to monitor by creating entries
in the <B>/usr/afs/local/BosConfig</B> file as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ154">Controlling and Checking Process Status</A>
<P><LI>Stopping and starting processes on the file server machines according to
subsequent instructions in this chapter
<P><LI>Defining your cell's database server machines in the
<B>/usr/afs/etc/CellServDB</B> file as described in <A HREF="auagd008.htm#HDRWQ118">Maintaining the Server CellServDB File</A>
<P><LI>Defining AFS server encryption keys in the <B>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</B>
file as described in <A HREF="auagd014.htm#HDRWQ355">Managing Server Encryption Keys</A>.
<P><LI>Granting system administrator privileges with respect to BOS Server,
Volume Server, and Backup Server operations, by adding a user to the
<B>/usr/afs/etc/UserList</B> file as described in <A HREF="auagd021.htm#HDRWQ592">Administering the UserList File</A>
<P><LI>Setting authorization checking requirements on a server machine as
described in <A HREF="auagd008.htm#HDRWQ123">Managing Authentication and Authorization Requirements</A>
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ147" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_168">The buserver Process: the Backup Server</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX6256"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6257"></A>
<P>The <B>buserver</B> process, which runs on database server machines, is
the Backup Server. It maintains information about Backup System
configuration and operations in the Backup Database.
<P>The process appears as <TT>buserver</TT> in the <B>bos status</B>
command's output, if the conventional name is assigned. It appears
in the <B>ps</B> command's output as
<TT>/usr/afs/bin/buserver</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX6258"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6259"></A>
<P>As a system administrator, you contact the Backup Server when you issue any
<B>backup</B> command that manipulates information in the Backup Database,
including those that change Backup System configuration information, that dump
data from volumes to permanent storage, or that restore data to AFS.
See <A HREF="auagd011.htm#HDRWQ248">Configuring the AFS Backup System</A> and <A HREF="auagd012.htm#HDRWQ283">Backing Up and Restoring AFS Data</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ148" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_169">The fs Collection of Processes: the File Server, Volume Server and Salvager</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX6260"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6261"></A>
<P>The <B>fs</B> process, which runs on every file server machine,
combines three component processes: File Server, Volume Server and
Salvager. The three components perform independent functions, but are
controlled as a single process for the following reasons.
<UL>
<P><LI>They all operate on the same data, namely files and directories stored in
AFS volumes. Combining them as a single process enables them to
coordinate their actions, never attempting simultaneous operations on the same
data that can possibly corrupt it.
<P><LI>It enables the BOS Server to stop and restart the processes in the
required order. When the File Server fails, the BOS Server stops the
Volume Server and runs the Salvager to correct any corruption that resulted
from the failure. (The Salvager runs only in this special circumstance
or when you invoke it yourself by issuing the <B>bos salvage</B> command
as instructed in <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ232">Salvaging Volumes</A>.) If only the Volume Server fails, the BOS Server can
restart it without affecting the File Server or Salvager.
</UL>
<P>The File Server component handles AFS data at the level of files and
directories, manipulating file system elements as requested by application
programs and the standard operating system commands. Its main duty is
to deliver requested files to client machines and store them again on the
server machine when the client is finished. It also maintains status
and protection information about each file and directory. It runs
continuously during normal operation. 
<A NAME="IDX6262"></A>
<P>The Volume Server component handles AFS data at the level of complete
volumes rather than files and directories. In response to
<B>vos</B> commands, it creates, removes, moves, dumps and restores entire
volumes, among other actions. It runs continuously during normal
operation. 
<A NAME="IDX6263"></A>
<P>The Salvager component runs only after the failure of one of the other two
processes. It checks the file system for internal consistency and
repairs any errors it finds. 
<A NAME="IDX6264"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6265"></A>
<P>The process appears as <TT>fs</TT> in the <B>bos status</B>
command's output, if the conventional name is assigned. An
auxiliary message reports the status of the File Server or Salvager
component. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ158">Displaying Process Status and Information from the BosConfig File</A>.
<P>The component processes of the <B>fs</B> process appear individually in
the <B>ps</B> command's output, as follows. There is no entry
for the <TT>fs</TT> process itself.
<UL>
<P><LI><TT>/usr/afs/bin/fileserver</TT>
<P><LI><TT>/usr/afs/bin/volserver</TT>
<P><LI><TT>/usr/afs/bin/salvager</TT>
</UL>
<P>The Cache Manager contacts the File Server component on your behalf
whenever you access data or status information in an AFS file or directory or
issue file manipulation commands such as the UNIX <B>cp</B> and
<B>ls</B> commands. You can contact the File Server directly by
issuing <B>fs</B> commands that perform the following functions
<A NAME="IDX6266"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6267"></A>
<UL>
<P><LI>Administering the ACL of any directory in the file system as described in <A HREF="auagd020.htm#HDRWQ562">Managing Access Control Lists</A>
<P><LI>Installing new partitions for housing AFS volumes, in which case you must
restart the <B>fs</B> process for it to recognize the new partition;
for instructions, see <A HREF="auagd008.htm#HDRWQ130">Adding or Removing Disks and Partitions</A>
<P><LI>Creating and deleting volume mount points in the AFS filespace as
described in <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ208">Mounting Volumes</A>
<P><LI>Setting volume quota and displaying information about the space used and
available in a volume or partition as described in <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ234">Setting and Displaying Volume Quota and Current Size</A>
</UL>
<A NAME="IDX6268"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6269"></A>
<P>You contact the Volume Server component when you issue <B>vos</B>
commands that manipulate volumes in any way--creating, removing,
replicating, moving, renaming, converting to different formats, and
salvaging. For instructions, see <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ174">Managing Volumes</A>.
<P>The Salvager normally runs automatically in case of a failure. You
can also start it with the <B>bos salvage</B> command as described in <A HREF="auagd010.htm#HDRWQ232">Salvaging Volumes</A>.
<A NAME="IDX6270"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6271"></A>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ149" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_170">The kaserver Process: the Authentication Server</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX6272"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6273"></A>
<P>The <B>kaserver</B> process, which runs on database server machines, is
the Authentication Server responsible for several aspects of AFS
security. It verifies AFS user identity by requiring a password.
It maintains all AFS server encryption keys and user passwords in the
Authentication Database. The Authentication Server's Ticket
Granting Service (TGS) module creates the shared secrets that AFS client and
server processes use when establishing secure connections.
<P>The process appears as <TT>kaserver</TT> in the <B>bos status</B>
command's output, if the conventional name is assigned. The
<B>ka</B> string stands for <I>Kerberos Authentication</I>, reflecting
the fact that AFS's authentication protocols are based on Kerberos, which
was originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Project Athena.
<P>It appears in the <B>ps</B> command's output as
<TT>/usr/afs/bin/kaserver</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX6274"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6275"></A>
<P>As a system administrator, you contact the Authentication Server when you
issue <B>kas</B> commands to perform the following kinds of tasks.
<UL>
<P><LI>Setting a user's password. Users normally change their own
passwords, so you probably perform this task only creating a new user account
as described in <A HREF="auagd018.htm#HDRWQ502">Creating AFS User Accounts</A> and <A HREF="auagd018.htm#HDRWQ516">Changing AFS Passwords</A>.
<P><LI>Setting the AFS server encryption key in the Authentication Database,
which the TGS uses to seal server tickets; see <A HREF="auagd014.htm#HDRWQ355">Managing Server Encryption Keys</A>.
<P><LI>Granting or revoking system administrator privileges with respect to the
Authentication Server as described in <A HREF="auagd021.htm#HDRWQ589">Granting Privilege for kas Commands:  the ADMIN Flag</A>.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ150" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_171">The ptserver Process: the Protection Server</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX6276"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6277"></A>
<P>The <B>ptserver</B> process, which runs on database server machines, is
the Protection Server. Its main responsibility is maintaining the
Protection Database which contains user, machine, and group entries.
The Protection Server allocates AFS IDs and maintains the mapping between them
and names. The File Server consults the Protection Server when
verifying that a user is authorized to perform a requested action.
<P>The process appears as <TT>ptserver</TT> in the <B>bos status</B>
command's output, if the conventional name is assigned. It appears
in the <B>ps</B> command's output as
<TT>/usr/afs/bin/ptserver</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX6278"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6279"></A>
<P>As a system administrator, you contact the Protection Server when you issue
<B>pts</B> commands to perform the following kinds of tasks.
<UL>
<P><LI>Creating a new user, machine, or group entry in the Protection Database as
described in <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ531">Administering the Protection Database</A>
<P><LI>Adding or removing group members or otherwise manipulating Protection
Database entries as described in <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ531">Administering the Protection Database</A>
<P><LI>Granting or revoking system administrator privilege by changing the
membership of the <B>system:administrators</B> group as described in
<A HREF="auagd021.htm#HDRWQ586">Administering the system:administrators Group</A>
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ151" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_172">The runntp Process</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX6280"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6281"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6282"></A>
<P>The <B>runntp</B> process, which runs on every server machine, is a
controller program for the Network Time Protocol Daemon (NTPD), which
synchronizes the hardware clocks on server machines. You need to run
the <B>runntp</B> process if you are not already running NTP or another
time synchronization protocol on your server machines.
<P>The clocks on database server machines need to be synchronized because
AFS's distributed database technology (Ubik) works properly only when the
clocks agree within a narrow range of variation (see <A HREF="auagd008.htm#HDRWQ103">Configuring the Cell for Proper Ubik Operation</A>). The clocks on file server machines need to be
correct not only because the File Server sets modification time stamps on
files, but because in the conventional configuration they serve as the time
source for AFS client machines.
<P>The process appears as <TT>runntp</TT> in the <B>bos status</B>
command's output, if the conventional name is assigned. It appears
in the output from the <B>ps</B> command as
<TT>/usr/afs/bin/runntp</TT>. The <B>ps</B> command's output
also includes an entry called <TT>ntpd</TT>; its exact form depends on
the arguments you provide to the <B>runntp</B> command.
<A NAME="IDX6283"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6284"></A>
<P>As a system administrator, you do not contact the NTPD directly once you
have installed it according to the instructions in the <I>IBM AFS Quick
Beginnings</I>.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ152" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_173">The upserver and upclient Processes: the Update Server</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX6285"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6286"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6287"></A>
<P>The Update Server has two separate parts, each of which runs on a different
type of server machine. The <B>upserver</B> process is the server
portion of the Update Server. Its function depends on which edition of
AFS you use:
<UL>
<P><LI>With both the United States and international editions, it runs on the
binary distribution machine of each system type you use as a server machine,
distributing the contents of each one's <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory
to the other server machines of that type. This guarantees that all
machines have the same version of AFS binaries. (For a list of the
binaries, see <A HREF="auagd008.htm#HDRWQ84">Binaries in the /usr/afs/bin Directory</A>.)
<P><LI>In you use the United States edition of AFS, it also runs on the
cell's system control machine, distributing the contents of its
<B>/usr/afs/etc</B> directory to all the other server machines in order to
synchronize the configuration files stored in that directory. (For a
list of the configuration files, see <A HREF="auagd008.htm#HDRWQ85">Common Configuration Files in the /usr/afs/etc Directory</A>.)
</UL>
<P>The <B>upclient</B> process is the client portion of the Update Server,
and like the server portion its function depends on the AFS edition in
use.
<UL>
<P><LI>It runs on every server machine that is not a binary distribution machine,
referencing the binary distribution machine of its system type as the source
for updates to the binaries in the <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory.
The conventional process name to assign is <B>upclientbin</B>.
<P><LI>If you use the United States edition of AFS, another instance of the
process runs on every server machine except the system control machine.
It references the system control machine as the source for updates to the
common configuration files in the <B>/usr/afs/etc</B> directory.
The conventional process name to assign is <B>upclientetc</B>.
</UL>
<P>In output from the <B>bos status</B> command, the server portion
appears as <TT>upserver</TT> and the client portions as
<TT>upclientbin</TT> and <TT>upclientetc</TT>, if the conventional names
are assigned. In the output from the <B>ps</B> command, the server
portion appears as <TT>/usr/afs/bin/upserver</TT> and the client portions as
<TT>/usr/afs/bin/upclient</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX6288"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6289"></A>
<P>You do not contact the Update Server directly once you have installed
it. It operates automatically whenever you use <B>bos</B> commands
to change the files that it distributes.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ153" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_174">The vlserver Process: the Volume Location Server</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX6290"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6291"></A>
<P>The <B>vlserver</B> process, which runs on database server machines, is
the Volume Location (VL) Server that automatically tracks which file server
machines house each volume, making its location transparent to client
applications.
<P>The process appears as <TT>vlserver</TT> in the <B>bos status</B>
command's output, if the conventional name is assigned. It appears
in the <B>ps</B> command's output as
<TT>/usr/afs/bin/vlserver</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX6292"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6293"></A>
<A NAME="IDX6294"></A>
<P>As a system administrator, you contact the VL Server when you issue any
<B>vos</B> command that changes the status of a volume (it records the
status changes in the VLDB).
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ154" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_175">Controlling and Checking Process Status</A></H2>
<P>To define the AFS server processes that run on a server
machine, use the <B>bos create</B> command to create entries for them in
the local <B>/usr/afs/local/BosConfig</B> file. The BOS Server
monitors the processes listed in the <B>BosConfig</B> file that are marked
with the <TT>Run</TT> status flag, and automatically attempts to restart
them if they fail. After creating process entries, you use other
commands from the <B>bos</B> suite to stop and start processes or change
the status flag as desired.
<P>Never edit the <B>BosConfig</B> file directly rather than using
<B>bos</B> commands. Similarly, it is not a good practice to run
server processes without listing them in the <B>BosConfig</B> file, or to
stop them using process termination commands such as the UNIX <B>kill</B>
command.

<P>A process's entry in the <B>BosConfig</B> file includes the
following information:
<UL>
<P><LI>The process's name. The recommended conventional names are
defined in both the <I>IBM AFS Quick Beginnings</I> and <A HREF="#HDRWQ161">Creating and Removing Processes</A>. The name of a simple process usually matches the

first server machine you install to act as the system control machine, running
the server portion of the Update Server (<B>upserver</B> process) to

<P><LI><TT>temporarily enabled</TT> indicates that the process is running but
that its status flag in the <B>BosConfig</B> file is
<TT>NotRun</TT>. The most common reason is that a system
administrator has used the <B>bos startup</B> command to start the
process.
<P><LI><TT>temporarily disabled</TT> indicates that the process is not running
even though its status flag in the <B>BosConfig</B> file is
<TT>Run</TT>. The most common reasons are either that a system
administrator has used the <B>bos shutdown</B> command to stop the process
or that the BOS Server ceased trying to restart the process after numerous
failed attempts. In the latter case, a supplementary message
appears: <TT>stopped for too many errors</TT>.
<P><LI><TT>disabled</TT> indicates that the process is not running and that its
status flag in the <B>BosConfig</B> file is <TT>NotRun</TT>. The
BOS Server is not monitoring the process. Only a system administrator
can set the flag this way; the BOS Server never does.

<P><LI><TT>file server running</TT> indicates that the File Server and Volume
Server components of the File Server process are running normally.
<P><LI><TT>salvaging file system</TT> indicates that the Salvager is running,

started.
<P><LI>The <TT>Last error exit</TT> time when the process (or one of the
component processes in the <B>fs</B> process) last failed due to an
error. A further explanation such as <TT>due to shutdown request</TT>
sometimes appears. This line does not appear if the process has not
failed since the BOS Server started.
<P><LI>Each command that the BOS Server invokes to start the process, as
specified by the <B>-cmd</B> argument to the <B>bos create</B>
command.
<P><LI>The pathname of the notifier program that the BOS Server invokes when the
process terminates (if any), as specified by the <B>-notifier</B> argument
to the <B>bos create</B> command.

<P>In addition, if the BOS Server has found that the mode bits on certain
files and directories under <B>/usr/afs</B> deviate from what it expects,
it prints the following warning message:
<PRE>   Bosserver process reports inappropriate access on server directories
</PRE>
<P>The expected protections for the directories and files in the

<P>It is sometimes necessary to halt a process temporarily (for
example, to make slight configuration changes or to perform
maintenance). The commands described in this section change a
process's status in the BOS Server's memory only; the effect is
immediate and lasts until you change the memory state again (or until the BOS
Server restarts, at which time it starts the process according to its entry in
the <B>BosConfig</B> file).
<P>To stop a process temporarily by changing its status flag in BOS Server
memory to <TT>NotRun</TT>, use the <B>bos shutdown</B> command.
To restart a stopped process by changing its status flag in the BOS
Server's memory to <TT>Run</TT>, use the <B>bos startup</B>
command. The process starts regardless of its status flag in the
<B>BosConfig</B> file. You can also use the <B>bos startup</B>
command to start all processes marked with status flag <TT>Run</TT> in the
<B>BosConfig</B> file, as described in the following instructions.
<P>Because the <B>bos startup</B> command starts a process without
changing it status flag in the <B>BosConfig</B> file, it is useful for
testing a server process without enabling it permanently. To stop and

<P>The BOS Server by default restarts once a week, and the new instance
restarts all processes marked with status flag <TT>Run</TT> in the local
<B>/usr/afs/local/BosConfig</B> file (this is equivalent to issuing the
<B>bos restart</B> command with the <B>-bosserver</B> flag).
The default restart time is Sunday at 4:00 a.m. The weekly
restart is designed to minimize <I>core leaks</I>, which can develop as a
process continues to allocate virtual memory but does not free it
again. When the memory is completely exhausted, the machine can no
longer function correctly.
<P>The BOS Server also by default checks once a day for any newly installed
binary files. If it finds that the modification time stamp on a
process's binary file in the <B>/usr/afs/bin</B> directory is more
recent than the time at which the process last started, it restarts the
process so that a new instance starts using the new binary file. The
default binary-checking time is 5:00 a.m.
<P>Because restarts can cause outages during which the file system is
inaccessible, the default times for restarts are in the early morning when
usage is likely to be lowest. Restarting a database server process on
any database server machine usually makes the entire system unavailable to
everyone for a brief time, whereas restarting other types of processes
inconveniences only users interacting with that process on that
machine. The longest outages typically result from restarting the
<B>fs</B> process, because the File Server must reattach all
volumes.

<P>The <B>/usr/afs/logs</B> directory on each file server machine contains
log files that detail interesting events that occur during normal operation of
some AFS server processes. The self-explanatory information in the log
files can help you evaluate process failures and other problems. To
display a log file remotely, issue the <B>bos getlog</B> command.
You can also establish a connection to the server machine and use a text
editor or other file display program (such as the <B>cat</B>
command).
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">Log files can grow unmanageably large if you do not periodically shutdown and
restart the database server processes (for example, if you disable the general
restart time). In this case it is a good policy periodically to issue
the UNIX <B>rm</B> command to delete the current log file. The
server process automatically creates a new one as needed.
