<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ326" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_362">Using the scout Program</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX7102"></A>
<P>The <B>scout</B> program monitors the status of the File Server process
running on file server machines. It periodically collects statistics
from a specified set of File Server processes, displays them in a graphical
format, and alerts you if any of the statistics exceed a configurable
threshold.
<P>More specifically, the <B>scout</B> program includes the following
features.
<UL>
<P><LI>You can monitor, from a single location, the File Server process on any
number of server machines from the local and foreign cells. The number
is limited only by the size of the display window, which must be large enough
to display the statistics.
<P><LI>You can set a threshold for many of the statistics. When the value
of a statistic exceeds the threshold, the <B>scout</B> program highlights
it (displays it in reverse video) to draw your attention to it. If the
value goes back under the threshold, the highlighting is deactivated.
You control the thresholds, so highlighting reflects what you consider to be a
noteworthy situation. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ332">Highlighting Significant Statistics</A>.
<P><LI>The <B>scout</B> program alerts you to File Server process, machine,
and network outages by highlighting the name of each machine that does not
respond to its probe, enabling you to respond more quickly.
<P><LI>You can set how often the <B>scout</B> program collects statistics
from the File Server processes.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ327" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_363">System Requirements</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7103"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7105"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7106"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7107"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7108"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7109"></A>
<P>The <B>scout</B> program runs on any AFS client machine that has access
to the <B>curses</B> graphics package, which most UNIX distributions
include as a standard utility. It can run on both dumb terminals and
under windowing systems that emulate terminals, but the output looks best on
machines that support reverse video and cursor addressing. For best
results, set the TERM environment variable to the correct terminal type, or
one with characteristics similar to the actual ones. For machines
running AIX, the recommended TERM setting is <B>vt100</B>, assuming the
terminal is similar to that. For other operating systems, the wider
range of acceptable values includes <B>xterm</B>, <B>xterms</B>,
<B>vt100</B>, <B>vt200</B>, and <B>wyse85</B>.
<A NAME="IDX7110"></A>
<P>No privilege is required to run the <B>scout</B> program, so any user
who can access the directory where its binary resides (the
<B>/usr/afsws/bin</B> directory in the conventional configuration) can use
it. The program's probes for collecting statistics do not impose a
significant burden on the File Server process, but you can restrict its use by
placing the binary file in a directory with a more restrictive access control
list (ACL).
<P>Multiple instances of the <B>scout</B> program can run on a single
client machine, each over its own dedicated connection (in its own
window). It must run in the foreground, so the window in which it runs
does not accept further input except for an interrupt signal.
<P>You can also run the <B>scout</B> program on several machines and view
its output on a single machine, by opening telnet connections to the other
machines from the central one and initializing the program in each remote
window. In this case, you can include the <B>-host</B> flag to the
<B>scout</B> command to make the name of each remote machine appear in the
<I>banner line</I> at the top of the window displaying its output.
See <A HREF="#HDRWQ330">The Banner Line</A>.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ328" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_364">Using the -basename argument to Specify a Domain Name</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7111"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7112"></A>
<P>As previously mentioned, the <B>scout</B> program can monitor the File
Server process on any number of file server machines. If all of the
machines belong to the same cell, then their hostnames probably all have the
same domain name suffix, such as <B>abc.com</B> in the ABC
Corporation cell. In this case, you can use the <B>-basename</B>
argument to the <B>scout</B> command, which has several advantages:
<UL>
<P><LI>You can omit the domain name suffix as you enter each file server
machine's name on the command line. The <B>scout</B> program
automatically appends the domain name to each machine's name, resulting
in a fully-qualified hostname. You can omit the domain name suffix even
when you don't include the <B>-basename</B> argument, but in that
case correct resolution of the name depends on the state of your cell's
naming service at the time of connection.
<P><LI>The machine names are more likely to fit in the appropriate column of the
display without having to be truncated (for more on truncating names in the
display column, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ331">The Statistics Display Region</A>).
<P><LI>The domain name appears in the banner line at the top of the display
window to indicate the name of the cell you are monitoring.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ329" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_365">The Layout of the scout Display</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7113"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7114"></A>
<P>The <B>scout</B> program can display statistics either in a dedicated
window or on a plain screen if a windowing environment is not
available. For best results, use a window or screen that can print in
reverse video and do cursor addressing.
<P>The <B>scout</B> program screen has three main regions: the
<I>banner line</I>, the <I>statistics display region</I> and the
<I>probe/message line</I>. This section describes their contents,
and graphic examples appear in <A HREF="#HDRWQ336">Example Commands and Displays</A>.
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ330">The Banner Line</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX7115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7116"></A>
<P>By default, the string <TT>scout</TT> appears in the banner line at the
top of the window or screen, to indicate that the <B>scout</B> program is
running. You can display two additional types of information by include
the appropriate option on the command line:
<UL>
<P><LI>Include the <B>-host</B> flag to display the local machine's name
in the banner line. This is particularly useful when you are running
the <B>scout</B> program on several machines but displaying the results on
a single machine.
<P>For example, the following banner line appears when you run the
<B>scout</B> program on the machine
<B>client1.abc.com</B> and use the<B>-host</B>
flag: 
<PRE>   [client1.abc.com] scout
</PRE>
<P><LI>Include the <B>-basename</B> argument to display the specified cell
domain name in the banner line. For further discussion, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ328">Using the -basename argument to Specify a Domain Name</A>. 
<P>For example, if you specify a value of <B>abc.com</B> for the
<B>-basename</B> argument, the banner line reads: 
<PRE>   scout for abc.com
</PRE>
</UL>
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ331">The Statistics Display Region</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX7117"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7118"></A>
<P>The statistics display region occupies most of the window and is divided
into six columns. The following list describes them as they appear from
left to right in the window.
<DL>
<P><DT><B><TT>Conn</TT>
<A NAME="IDX7119"></A>
</B><DD>Displays the number of RPC connections open between the File Server
process and client machines. This number normally equals or exceeds the
number in the fourth <TT>Ws</TT> column. It can exceed the number in
that column because each user on the machine can have more than one connection
open at once, and one client machine can handle several users.
<P><DT><B><TT>Fetch</TT>
<A NAME="IDX7120"></A>
</B><DD>Displays the number of fetch-type RPCs (fetch data, fetch access list, and
fetch status) that the File Server process has received from client machines
since it started. It resets to zero when the File Server process
restarts.
<P><DT><B><TT>Store</TT>
<A NAME="IDX7121"></A>
</B><DD>Displays the number of store-type RPCs (store data, store access list, and
store status) that the File Server process has received from client machines
since it started. It resets to zero when the File Server process
restarts.
<P><DT><B><TT>Ws</TT>
<A NAME="IDX7122"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7123"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7124"></A>
</B><DD>Displays the number of client machines (workstations) that have
communicated with the File Server process within the last 15 minutes (such
machines are termed <I>active</I>). This number is likely to be
smaller than the number in the <TT>Conn</TT>) column because a single client
machine can have several connections open to one File Server process.
<P><DT><B>[Unlabeled column]
</B><DD>Displays the name of the file server machine on which the File Server
process is running. It is 12 characters wide. Longer names are
truncated and an asterisk (<TT>*</TT>) appears as the last character in the
name. If all machines have the same domain name suffix, you can use the
<B>-basename</B> argument to decrease the need for truncation; see <A HREF="#HDRWQ328">Using the -basename argument to Specify a Domain Name</A>.
<P><DT><B><TT>Disk attn</TT>
<A NAME="IDX7125"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7126"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7127"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7128"></A>
</B><DD>Displays the number of kilobyte blocks available on up to 26 of the file
server machine's AFS server (<B>/vicep</B>) partitions. The
display for each partition has the following format: 
<PRE>   <VAR>partition_letter</VAR>:<VAR>free_blocks</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
<P>For example, <TT>a:8949</TT> indicates that partition
<B>/vicepa</B> has 8,949 KB free. If the window is not wide enough
for all partition entries to appear on a single line, the <B>scout</B>
program automatically stacks the partition entries into subcolumns within the
sixth column.
<P>The label on the <TT>Disk attn</TT> column indicates the threshold value
at which entries in the column become highlighted. By default, the
<B>scout</B> program highlights a partition that is over 95% full, in
which case the label is as follows: 
<PRE>   Disk attn: > 95% used
</PRE>
<P>
<P>For more on this threshold and its effect on highlighting, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ332">Highlighting Significant Statistics</A>.
</DL>
<P>For all columns except the fifth (file server machine name), you can use
the <B>-attention</B> argument to set a threshold value above which the
<B>scout</B> program highlights the statistic. By default, only
values in the fifth and sixth columns ever become highlighted. For
instructions on using the <B>-attention</B> argument, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ332">Highlighting Significant Statistics</A>.
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_368">The Probe Reporting Line</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX7129"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7130"></A>
<P>The bottom line of the display indicates how many times the
<B>scout</B> program has probed the File Server processes for
statistics. The statistics gathered in the latest probe appear in the
statistics display region. By default, the <B>scout</B> program
probes the File Servers every 60 seconds, but you can use the
<B>-frequency</B> argument to specify a different probe frequency.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ332" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_369">Highlighting Significant Statistics</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7131"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7132"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7133"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7134"></A>
<P>To draw your attention to a statistic that currently exceed a threshold
value, the <B>scout</B> program displays it in reverse video (highlights
it). You can set the threshold value for most statistics, and so
determine which values are worthy of special attention and which are
normal.
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ333">Highlighting Server Outages</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX7135"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7136"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7137"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7139"></A>
<P>The only column in which you cannot control highlighting is the fifth,
which identifies the file server machine for which statistics are displayed in
the other columns. The <B>scout</B> program uses highlighting in
this column to indicate that the File Server process on a machine fails to
respond to its probe, and automatically blanks out the other columns.
Failure to respond to the probe can indicate a File Server process, file
server machine, or network outage, so the highlighting draws your attention to
a situation that is probably interrupting service to users.
<P>When the File Server process once again responds to the probes, its name
appears normally and statistics reappear in the other columns. If all
machine names become highlighted at once, a possible network outage has
disrupted the connection between the file server machines and the client
machine running the <B>scout</B> program.
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_371">Highlighting for Extreme Statistic Values</A></H4>
<P>To set the threshold value for one or more of the five
statistics-displaying columns, use the <B>-attention</B> argument.
The threshold value applies to all File Server processes you are monitoring
(you cannot set different thresholds for different machines). For
details, see the syntax description in <A HREF="#HDRWQ335">To start the scout program</A>.
<P>It is not possible to change the threshold values for a running
<B>scout</B> program. Stop the current program and start a new
one. Also, the <B>scout</B> program does not retain threshold
values across restarts, so you must specify all thresholds every time you
start the program.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ334" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_372">Resizing the scout Display</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7140"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7141"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7142"></A>
<P>Do not resize the display window while the <B>scout</B> program is
running. Increasing the size does no harm, but the <B>scout</B>
program does not necessarily adjust to the new dimensions. Decreasing
the display's width can disturb column alignment, making the display
harder to read. With any type of resizing, the <B>scout</B> program
does not adjust the display in any way until it displays the results of the
next probe.
<P>To resize the display effectively, stop the <B>scout</B> program,
resize the window and then restart the program. Even in this case, the
<B>scout</B> program's response depends on the accuracy of the
information it receives from the display environment. Testing during
development has shown that the display environment does not reliably provide
information about window resizing. If you use the X windowing system,
issuing the following sequence of commands before starting the
<B>scout</B> program (or placing them in the shell initialization file)
sometimes makes it adjust properly to resizing.

</B><DD>Identifies each File Server process to monitor, by naming the file server
machine it is running on. Provide fully-qualified hostnames unless the
<B>-basename</B> argument is used. In that case, specify only the
initial part of each machine name, omitting the domain name suffix common to
all the machine names.

named by the <B>-server</B> argument. For discussion of this
argument's effects, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ328">Using the -basename argument to Specify a Domain Name</A>. 
<P>Do not include the period that separates the domain suffix from the initial
part of the machine name, but do include any periods that occur within the

<B>-basename</B> argument, relying on the cell's name service to
obtain the fully-qualified name that the <B>scout</B> program requires for
establishing a connection.
<PRE>   % <B>scout -server fs1 fs2</B> 
</PRE>
<P><A HREF="#FIGWQ337">Figure 2</A> depicts the resulting display. Notice first that the
machine names in the fifth (unlabeled) column appear in the format the
administrator used on the command line. Now consider the second line in
the display region, where the machine name <TT>fs2</TT> appears in the fifth
column. The <TT>Conn</TT> and <TT>Ws</TT> columns together show
that machine <B>fs2</B> has 144 RPC connections open to 44 client
machines, demonstrating that multiple connections per client machine are
possible. The <TT>Fetch</TT> column shows that client machines have
made 2,734,278 fetch RPCs to machine <B>fs2</B> since the File Server
process last started and the <TT>Store</TT> column shows that they have made
34,066 store RPCs.
<P>Six partition entries appear in the <TT>Disk attn</TT> column, marked
<TT>a</TT> through <TT>f</TT> (for <B>/vicepa</B> through
<B>/vicepf</B>). They appear on three lines in two subcolumns
because of the width of the window; if the window is wider, there are
more subcolumns. Four of the partition entries (<TT>a</TT>,
<TT>c</TT>, <TT>d</TT>, and <TT>e</TT>) appear in reverse video to
indicate that they are more than 95% full (the threshold value that appears in
the <TT>Disk attn</TT> header).

<P>In the second example, the administrator uses more of the <B>scout</B>
program's optional arguments.
<UL>
<P><LI>She provides the machine names in the same form as in Example 1, but this
time she also uses the <B>-basename</B> argument to specify their domain
name suffix, <B>abc.com</B>. This implies that the
<B>scout</B> program does not need the name service to expand the names to
fully-qualified hostnames, but the name service still converts the hostnames
to IP addresses.
<P><LI>She uses the <B>-host</B> flag to display in the banner line the name
of the client machine where the <B>scout</B> program is running.
<P><LI>She uses the <B>-frequency</B> argument to changes the probing
frequency from its default of once per minute to once every five
seconds.
<P><LI>She uses the <B>-attention</B> argument to changes the highlighting
threshold for partitions to a 5000 KB minimum rather than the default of 95%
full.
</UL>
<PRE>   % <B>scout -server fs1 fs2 -basename abc.com -host -frequency 5 -attention disk 5000</B> 
</PRE>
<P>The use of optional arguments results in several differences between <A HREF="#FIGWQ338">Figure 3</A> and <A HREF="#FIGWQ337">Figure 2</A>. First, because the <B>-host</B>
flag is included, the banner line displays the name of the machine running the
<B>scout</B> process as <TT>[client52]</TT> along with the basename
<TT>abc.com</TT> specified with the <B>-basename</B>
argument.
<P>Another difference is that two rather than four of machine
<B>fs2</B>'s partitions appear in reverse video, even though their
values are almost the same as in <A HREF="#FIGWQ337">Figure 2</A>. This is because the administrator changed the
highlight threshold to a 5000 block minimum, as also reflected in the
<TT>Disk attn</TT> column's header. And while machine
<B>fs2</B>'s partitions <B>/vicepa</B> and <B>/vicepd</B> are
still 95% full, they have more than 5000 free blocks left; partitions
<B>/vicepc</B> and <B>/vicepe</B> are highlighted because they have
fewer than 5000 blocks free.
<P>Note also the result of changing the probe frequency, reflected in the
probe reporting line at the bottom left corner of the display. Both
this example and the previous one represent a time lapse of one minute after
the administrator issues the <B>scout</B> command. In this example,
however, the <B>scout</B> program has probed the File Server processes 12
times as opposed to once

<P>This section describes the <B>fstrace</B> commands that
system administrators employ to trace Cache Manager activity for debugging
purposes. It assumes the reader is familiar with the Cache Manager
concepts described in <A HREF="auagd015.htm#HDRWQ387">Administering Client Machines and the Cache Manager</A>.
<P>The <B>fstrace</B> command suite monitors the internal activity of the
Cache Manager and enables you to record, or trace, its operations in
detail. The operations, which are termed <I>events</I>, comprise
the <B>cm</B> <I>event set</I>. Examples of <B>cm</B>
events are fetching files and looking up information for a listing of files
and subdirectories using the UNIX <B>ls</B> command.
<P>Following are the <B>fstrace</B> commands and their respective
functions:
<UL>
<P><LI>The <B>fstrace apropos</B> command provides a short description of
commands.
<P><LI>The <B>fstrace clear</B> command clears the trace log.
<P><LI>The <B>fstrace dump</B> command dumps the contents of the trace
log.
<P><LI>The <B>fstrace help</B> command provides a description and syntax for
commands.
<P><LI>The <B>fstrace lslog</B> command lists information about the trace
log.
<P><LI>The <B>fstrace lsset</B> command lists information about the event
set.
<P><LI>The <B>fstrace setlog</B> command changes the size of the trace
log.
<P><LI>The <B>fstrace setset</B> command sets the state of the event
set.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ342" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_377">About the fstrace Command Suite</A></H3>
<P>The <B>fstrace</B> command suite replaces and greatly
expands the functionality formerly provided by the <B>fs debug</B>
command. Its intended use is to aid in diagnosis of specific Cache
Manager problems, such as client machine hangs, cache consistency problems,
clock synchronization errors, and failures to access a volume or AFS
file. Therefore, it is best not to keep <B>fstrace</B> logging
enabled at all times, unlike the logging for AFS server processes.
<P>Most of the messages in the trace log correspond to low-level Cache Manager
operations. It is likely that only personnel familiar with the AFS
source code can interpret them. If you have an AFS source license, you
can attempt to interpret the trace yourself, or work with the AFS Product
Support group to resolve the underlying problems. If you do not have an
AFS source license, it is probably more efficient to contact the AFS Product
Support group immediately in case of problems. They can instruct you to
activate <B>fstrace</B> tracing if appropriate.
<P>The log can grow in size very quickly; this can use valuable disk
space if you are writing to a file in the local file space.
Additionally, if the size of the log becomes too large, it can become
difficult to parse the results for pertinent information.
<A NAME="IDX7154"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7155"></A>
<P>When AFS tracing is enabled, each time a <B>cm</B> event occurs, a
message is written to the trace log, <B>cmfx</B>. To diagnose a
problem, read the output of the trace log and analyze the operations executed
by the Cache Manager. The default size of the trace log is 60 KB, but
you can increase or decrease it.
<A NAME="IDX7156"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7157"></A>
<P>To use the <B>fstrace</B> command suite, you must first enable tracing
and reserve, or allocate, space for the trace log with the <B>fstrace
setset</B> command. With this command, you can set the <B>cm</B>
event set to one of three states to enable or disable tracing for the event
set and to allocate or deallocate space for the trace log in the kernel:
<A NAME="IDX7158"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7159"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7160"></A>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>active
</B><DD>Enables tracing for the event set and allocates space for the trace
log.
<P><DT><B>inactive
</B><DD>Temporarily disables tracing for the event set; however, the event
set continues to allocate space occupied by the log to which it sends
data.
<P><DT><B>dormant
</B><DD>Disables tracing for the event set; furthermore, the event set
releases the space occupied by the log to which it sends data. When the
<B>cm</B> event set that sends data to the <B>cmfx</B> trace log is in
this state, the space allocated for that log is freed or deallocated.
</DL>
<A NAME="IDX7161"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7162"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7163"></A>
<P>Both event sets and trace logs can be designated as <I>persistent</I>,
which prevents accidental resetting of an event set's state or clearing
of a trace log. The designation is made as the kernel is compiled and
cannot be changed.
<P>If an event set such as <B>cm</B> is persistent, you can change its
state only by including the <B>-set</B> argument to the <B>fstrace
setset</B> command. (That is, you cannot change its state along with
the state of all other event sets by issuing the <B>fstrace setset</B>
command with no arguments.) Similarly, if a trace log such as
<B>cmfx</B> is persistent, you can clear it only by including either the
<B>-set</B> or <B>-log</B> argument to the <B>fstrace clear</B>
command (you cannot clear it along with all other trace logs by issuing the
<B>fstrace clear</B> command with no arguments.)
<P>When a problem occurs, set the <B>cm</B> event set to active using the
<B>fstrace setset</B> command. When tracing is enabled on a busy
AFS client, the volume of events being recorded is significant;
therefore, when you are diagnosing problems, restrict AFS activity as much as
possible to minimize the amount of extraneous tracing in the log.
Because tracing can have a negative impact on system performance, leave
<B>cm</B> tracing in the dormant state when you are not diagnosing
problems.
<P>If a problem is reproducible, clear the <B>cmfx</B> trace log with the
<B>fstrace clear</B> command and reproduce the problem. If the
problem is not easily reproduced, keep the state of the event set active until
the problem recurs.
<P>To view the contents of the trace log and analyze the <B>cm</B> events,
use the <B>fstrace dump</B> command to copy the content lines of the trace
log to standard output (stdout) or to a file.

<P>Except for the <B>fstrace help</B> and <B>fstrace apropos</B>

requires that the issuer be logged in as the local superuser <B>root</B>
on the local client machine. Before issuing an <B>fstrace</B>
command, verify that you have the necessary privilege.
<P>The Cache Manager catalog must be in place so that logging can
occur. The <B>fstrace</B> command suite uses the standard UNIX
catalog utilities. The default location is
<B>/usr/vice/etc/C/afszcm.cat</B>. It can be placed in
another directory by placing the file elsewhere and using the proper NLSPATH

<UL>
<P><LI>Store the <B>fstrace</B> binary in a local disk directory.
<P><LI>When you dump the <B>fstrace</B> log to a file, direct it to one on
the local disk.
<P><LI>The trace can grow large in just a few minutes. Before attempting
to dump the log to a local file, verify that you have enough room. Be
particularly careful if you are using disk quotas on partitions in the local
file system.
<P><LI>Attempt to limit Cache Manager activity on the AFS client machine other
than the problem operation. This reduces the amount of extraneous data
in the trace.
<P><LI>Activate the <B>fstrace</B> log for the shortest possibly period of
time. If possible activate the trace immediately before performing the
problem operation, deactivate it as soon as the operation completes, and dump
the trace log to a file immediately.
<P><LI>If possible, obtain UNIX process ID (PID) of the command or program that
initiates the problematic operation. This enables the person analyzing
the trace log to search it for messages associated with the PID.

<P><LI>The timestamp associated with the message (number of seconds from an
arbitrary start point)
<P><LI>The process ID or thread ID associated with the message
<P><LI>The message itself
</UL>
<P>A trace log message is formatted as follows:
<PRE>   time <VAR>timestamp</VAR>, pid <VAR>pid</VAR>:<VAR>event message</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>where <I>timestamp</I> is the number of seconds from an arbitrary start
point, <I>pid</I> is the process ID number of the Cache Manager event, and
<I>event message</I> is the Cache Manager event which corresponds with a
function in the AFS source code.
<P>The following is an example of a dumped trace log message:
<PRE>   time 749.641274, pid 3002:Returning code 2 from 19
</PRE>
<P>For the messages in the trace log to be most readable, the Cache Manager
catalog file needs to be installed on the local disk of the client
machine; the conventional location is
<B>/usr/vice/etc/C/afszcm.cat</B>. Log messages that begin
with the string <TT>raw op</TT>, like the following, indicate that the
catalog is not installed.
<PRE>   raw op 232c, time 511.916288, pid 0
   p0:Fri Apr 16 10:36:31 1999
</PRE>
<P>Every 1024 seconds, a current time message is written to each log.
This message has the following format:
<PRE>   time <VAR>timestamp</VAR>, pid <VAR>pid</VAR>: Current time: <VAR>unix_time</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>where <VAR>timestamp</VAR> is the number of seconds from an arbitrary start
point, <VAR>pid</VAR> is the process ID number, and <VAR>unix_time</VAR> is the
standard time format since January 1, 1970.
<P>The current time message can be used to determine the actual time
associated with each log message. Determine the actual time as
follows:
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Locate the log message whose actual time you want to determine.
<P><LI>Search backward through the dump record until you come to a current time
message.
<P><LI>If the current time message's <I>timestamp</I> is smaller than
the log message's <I>timestamp</I>, subtract the former from the
latter. If the current time message's <I>timestamp</I> is
larger than the log message's <I>timestamp</I>, add 1024 to the
latter and subtract the former from the result.
<P><LI>Add the resulting number to the current time message's
<I>unix_time</I> to determine the log message's actual time.
</OL>
<P>Because log data is stored in a finite, circular buffer, some of the data
can be overwritten before being read. If this happens, the following
message appears at the appropriate place in the dump:
<PRE>   Log wrapped; data missing.

<P>This section contains an extensive example of the use of the
<B>fstrace</B> command suite, which is useful for gathering a detailed
trace of Cache Manager activity when you are working with AFS Product Support
to diagnose a problem. The Product Support representative can guide you
in choosing appropriate parameter settings for the trace.
<P>Before starting the kernel trace log, try to isolate the Cache Manager on
the AFS client machine that is experiencing the problem accessing the
file. If necessary, instruct users to move to another machine so as to
minimize the Cache Manager activity on this machine. To minimize the
amount of unrelated AFS activity recorded in the trace log, place both the
<B>fstrace</B> binary and the dump file must reside on the local disk, not
in AFS. You must be logged in as the local superuser <B>root</B> to
issue <B>fstrace</B> commands.
<P>Before starting a kernel trace, issue the <B>fstrace lsset</B> command
to check the state of the <B>cm</B> event set. 
<PRE>   # <B>fstrace lsset cm</B>
</PRE>
<P>If tracing has not been enabled previously or if tracing has been turned
off on the client machine, the following output is displayed: 
<PRE>   Available sets:
   cm inactive
</PRE>
<P>If tracing has been turned off and kernel memory is not allocated for the
trace log on the client machine, the following output is displayed: 
<PRE>   Available sets:
   cm inactive (dormant)
</PRE>
<P>If the current state of the <B>cm</B> event set is <TT>inactive</TT>
or <TT>inactive (dormant)</TT>, turn on kernel tracing by issuing the
<B>fstrace setset</B> command with the <B>-active</B> flag.
<PRE>   # <B>fstrace setset cm -active</B>
</PRE>
<P>If tracing is enabled currently on the client machine, the following output
is displayed:
<PRE>   Available sets:
   cm active
</PRE>
<P>If tracing is enabled currently, you do not need to use the <B>fstrace
setset</B> command. Do issue the <B>fstrace clear</B> command to
clear the contents of any existing trace log, removing prior traces that are
not related to the current problem.
<PRE>   # <B>fstrace clear cm</B>
</PRE>
<P>After checking on the state of the event set, issue the <B>fstrace
lslog</B> command with the <B>-long</B> flag to check the current state
and size of the kernel trace log .
<PRE>   # <B>fstrace lslog cmfx -long</B>
</PRE>
<P>If tracing has not been enabled previously or the <B>cm</B> event set
was set to <TT>active</TT> or <TT>inactive</TT> previously, output similar
to the following is displayed:
<PRE>   Available logs:
   cmfx : 60 kbytes (allocated)
</PRE>
<P>The <B>fstrace</B> tracing utility allocates 60 kilobytes of memory to
the trace log by default. You can increase or decrease the amount of
memory allocated to the kernel trace log by setting it with the <B>fstrace
setlog</B> command. The number specified with the
<B>-buffersize</B> argument represents the number of kilobytes allocated
to the kernel trace log. If you increase the size of the kernel trace
log to 100 kilobytes, issue the following command.
<PRE>   # <B>fstrace setlog cmfx</B> 100
</PRE>
<P>After ensuring that the kernel trace log is configured for your needs, you
can set up a file into which you can dump the kernel trace log. For
example, create a dump file with the name
<B>cmfx.dump.file.1</B> using the following
<B>fstrace dump</B> command. Issue the command as a continuous
process by adding the <B>-follow</B> and <B>-sleep</B>
arguments. Setting the <B>-sleep</B> argument to <I>10</I>
dumps output from the kernel trace log to the file every 10 seconds.

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ349" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_390">Using the afsmonitor Program</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX7193"></A>
<P>The <B>afsmonitor</B> program enables you to monitor the status and
performance of specified File Server and Cache Manager processes by gathering
statistical information. Among its other uses, the
<B>afsmonitor</B> program can be used to fine-tune Cache Manager
configuration and load balance File Servers.
<P>The <B>afsmonitor</B> program enables you to perform the following
tasks.
<UL>
<P><LI>Monitor any number of File Server and Cache Manager processes on any
number of machines (in both local and foreign cells) from a single
location.
<P><LI>Set threshold values for any monitored statistic. When the value of
a statistic exceeds the threshold, the <B>afsmonitor</B> program
highlights it to draw your attention. You can set threshold levels that
apply to every machine or only some.
<P><LI>Invoke programs or scripts automatically when a statistic exceeds its
threshold.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ350" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_391">Requirements for running the afsmonitor program</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7194"></A>
<P>The following software must be accessible to a machine where the
<B>afsmonitor</B> program is running:
<UL>
<P><LI>The AFS <B>xstat</B> libraries, which the <B>afsmonitor</B>
program uses to gather data
<P><LI>The <B>curses</B> graphics package, which most UNIX distributions
provide as a standard utility
</UL>
<A NAME="IDX7195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7196"></A>
<P>The <B>afsmonitor</B> screens format successfully both on so-called
dumb terminals and in windowing systems that emulate terminals. For the
output to looks its best, the display environment needs to support reverse
video and cursor addressing. Set the TERM environment variable to the
correct terminal type, or to a value that has characteristics similar to the
actual terminal type. The display window or terminal must be at least
80 columns wide and 12 lines long.
<A NAME="IDX7197"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7198"></A>
<A NAME="IDX7199"></A>
<P>The <B>afsmonitor</B> program must run in the foreground, and in its
own separate, dedicated window or terminal. The window or terminal is
unavailable for any other activity as long as the <B>afsmonitor</B>
program is running. Any number of instances of the
<B>afsmonitor</B> program can run on a single machine, as long as each
instance runs in its own dedicated window or terminal. Note that it can
take up to three minutes to start an additional instance.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX7200"></A>
No privilege is required to run the <B>afsmonitor</B> program. By
convention, it is installed in the <B>/usr/afsws/bin</B> directory, and
anyone who can access the directory can monitor File Servers and Cache
Managers. The probes through which the <B>afsmonitor</B> program
collects statistics do not constitute a significant burden on the File Server
or Cache Manager unless hundreds of people are running the program. If
you wish to restrict its use, place the binary file in a directory available
only to authorized users.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_392" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_392">The afsmonitor Output Screens</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX7201"></A>
<P>The <B>afsmonitor</B> program displays its data on three screens:
<UL>
<P><LI><TT>System Overview</TT>: This screen appears automatically when
the <B>afsmonitor</B> program initializes. It summarizes separately
for File Servers and Cache Managers the number of machines being monitored and
how many of them have <I>alerts</I> (statistics that have exceeded their
thresholds). It then lists the hostname and number of alerts for each
machine being monitored, indicating if appropriate that a process failed to
respond to the last probe.
<P><LI><TT>File Server</TT>: This screen displays File Server statistics
for each file server machine being monitored. It highlights statistics
that have exceeded their thresholds, and identifies machines that failed to
respond to the last probe.
<P><LI><TT>Cache Managers</TT>: This screen displays Cache Manager
statistics for each client machine being monitored. It highlights
statistics that have exceeded their thresholds, and identifies machines that
failed to respond to the last probe.
</UL>
<P>Fields at the corners of every screen display the following
information:
<UL>
<P><LI>In the top left corner, the program name and version number.
<P><LI>In the top right corner, the screen name, current and total page numbers,
and current and total column numbers. The page number (for example,
<TT>p. 1 of 3</TT>) indicates the index of the current page and the
total number of (vertical) pages over which data is displayed. The
column number (for example, <TT>c. 1 of 235</TT>) indicates the index
of the current leftmost column and the total number of columns in which data
appears. (The symbol <TT>>>></TT> indicates that there is additional
data to the right; the symbol <TT>&lt;&lt;&lt;</TT> indicates that
there is additional data to the left.)
<P><LI>In the bottom left corner, a list of the available commands. Enter
the first letter in the command name to run that command. Only the
currently possible options appear; for example, if there is only one page
of data, the <TT>next</TT> and <TT>prev</TT> commands, which scroll the
screen up and down respectively, do not appear. For descriptions of the
commands, see the following section about navigating the display
screens.
<P><LI>In the bottom right corner, the <TT>probes</TT> field reports how many
times the program has probed File Servers (<TT>fs</TT>), Cache Managers
(<TT>cm</TT>), or both. The counts for File Servers and Cache
Managers can differ. The <TT>freq</TT> field reports how often the
program sends probes.
</UL>
<P><B>Navigating the afsmonitor Display Screens</B>
<P>As noted, the lower left hand corner of every display screen displays the
names of the commands currently available for moving to alternate screens,
which can either be a different type or display more statistics or machines of
the current type. To execute a command, press the lowercase version of
the first letter in its name. Some commands also have an uppercase

grouping reports two pieces of information:
<UL>
<P><LI>The number of machines on which the program is monitoring the indicated
process
<P><LI>The number of alerts and the number of machines affected by them (an
<I>alert</I>means that a statistic has exceeded its threshold or a process
failed to respond to the last probe)
</UL>
<P>A list of the machines being monitored follows. If there are any
alerts on a machine, the number of them appears in square brackets to the left
of the hostname. If a process failed to respond to the last probe, the
letters <TT>PF</TT> (probe failure) appear in square brackets to the left of
the hostname.
<P>The following graphic is an example <TT>System Overview</TT>
screen. The <B>afsmonitor</B> program is monitoring six File
Servers and seven Cache Managers. The File Server process on host
<B>fs1.abc.com</B> and the Cache Manager on host
<B>cli33.abc.com</B> are each marked <TT>[ 1]</TT> to
indicate that one threshold value is exceeded. The <TT>[PF]</TT>
marker on host <B>fs6.abc.com</B> indicates that its File

<P>The <B>afsmonitor</B> program output file is a simple ASCII file that
records the information reported by the File Server and Cache Manager
screens. The output file has the following format:

<P>The <B>afsmonitor</B> program uses the <B>xstat</B> data collection
facility to gather and calculate the data that it (the <B>afsmonitor</B>
program) then uses to perform its function. You can also use the
<B>xstat</B> facility to create your own data display programs. If
you do, keep the following in mind. The File Server considers any
program calling its RPC routines to be a Cache Manager; therefore, any
program calling the File Server interface directly must export the Cache
Manager's callback interface. The calling program must be capable
of emulating the necessary callback state, and it must respond to periodic
keep-alive messages from the File Server. In addition, a calling
program must be able to gather the collected data.
<P>The <B>xstat</B> facility consists of two C language libraries
available to user-level applications:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>/usr/afsws/lib/afs/libxstat_fs.a</B> exports calls that
gather information from one or more running File Server processes.
<P><LI><B>/usr/afsws/lib/afs/libxstat_cm.a</B> exports calls that
collect information from one or more running Cache Managers.
</UL>

<UL>
<P><LI>A set of File Servers or Cache Managers to be examined.

The File Server and Cache Manager each define data collections that clients
can fetch. A data collection is simply a related set of numbers that
can be collected as a unit. For example, the File Server and Cache
Manager each define profiling and performance data collections. The
profiling collections maintain counts of the number of times internal
functions are called within servers, allowing bottleneck analysis to be
performed. The performance collections record, among other things,
internal disk I/O statistics for a File Server and cache effectiveness figures
for a Cache Manager, allowing for performance analysis.

audit events and the events that make up each class. It also defines
the classes of AFS audit events to audit for the File Server, which runs as
the local superuser <B>root</B>. The contents of this file must be
integrated into the corresponding AIX config file
(<B>/etc/security/audit/config</B>).
<P><LI>The <B>objects.sample</B> file contains a list of information
about audited files. You must only audit files in the local file
space. The contents of this file must be integrated into the
corresponding AIX objects file
(<B>/etc/security/audit/objects</B>).

<P>Once you have properly configured these files to include the AFS-relevant
information, use the AIX auditing system to start up and shut down the
auditing.
