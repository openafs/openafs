<P>To control access to a directory and all of the files in it,
AFS associates an <I>access control list</I> (<I>ACL</I>) with it,
rather than the mode bits that the UNIX file system (UFS) associates with
individual files or directories. AFS ACLs provide more refined access
control because there are seven access permissions rather than UFS's
three, and there is room for approximately 20 user or group entries on an ACL,
rather than just the three UFS entries (<B>owner</B>, <B>group</B>,
and <B>other</B>).

<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRWQ565" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_630">Protecting Data in AFS</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX8016"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8017"></A>
<P>This section describes the main differences between the AFS and UFS file
protection systems, discusses the implications of directory-level protections,
and describes the seven access permissions.
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ566" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_631">Differences Between UFS and AFS Data Protection</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX8018"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8019"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8020"></A>
<P>The UFS mode bits data protection system and the AFS ACL system differ in
the following ways:
<UL>
<P><LI>Protection at the file level (UFS) versus the directory level (AFS) 
<P>UFS associates a set of nine mode bits with each file element, three
(<B>rwx</B>) for each of the element's owner, owning group, and all
other users. A similar set of mode bits on the file's directory
applies to the file only in an oblique way.
<P>An AFS ACL instead protects all files in a directory in the same
way. If a certain file is more sensitive than others, store it in a
directory with a more restrictive ACL.
<P>Defining access at the directory level has important consequences: 
<A NAME="IDX8021"></A>
<UL>
<P><LI>The permissions on a directory's ACL apply to all of the files in the
directory. When you move a file to a different directory, you
effectively change the access permissions that apply to it to those on its new
directory's ACL. Changing a directory's ACL changes the
protection on all the files in it.
<P><LI>When you create a subdirectory, its initial ACL is created as a copy of
its parent directory's ACL. You can then change the
subdirectory's ACL independently. However, the parent
directory's ACL continues to control access to the subdirectory in the
following way: the parent directory's ACL must grant the
<B>l</B> (<B>lookup</B>) permission to a user (or a group the user
belongs to) in order for the user to access the subdirectory at all. 
<P>In general, then, it is best to assign fairly liberal access permissions to
high-level directories (including user home directories). In
particular, it often makes sense to grant at least the <B>l</B> permission
to the <B>system:anyuser</B> or <B>system:authuser</B>
group on high-level directories. For further discussion, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ571">Using Groups on ACLs</A>.
</UL>
<P><LI>How the mode bits are interpreted
<P>Mode bits are the only file-protection system in UFS. AFS allows you
to set the UNIX mode bits on a file in addition to the ACL on its directory,
but it interprets them differently. See <A HREF="#HDRWQ580">How AFS Interprets the UNIX Mode Bits</A>.
<P><LI>Three access permissions (UFS) versus seven (AFS)
<P>UFS defines three access permissions in the form of mode bits:
<B>r</B> (<B>read</B>), <B>w</B> (<B>write</B>), and
<B>x</B> (<B>execute</B>). AFS defines seven permissions, which
makes access control more precise. For detailed descriptions, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ567">The AFS ACL Permissions</A>.
<DL>
<DD><P><B>a</B> (<B>administer</B>)
<DD><P><B>d</B> (<B>delete</B>)
<DD><P><B>i</B> (<B>insert</B>)
<DD><P><B>k</B> (<B>lock</B>)
<DD><P><B>l</B> (<B>lookup</B>)
<DD><P><B>r</B> (<B>read</B>)
<DD><P><B>w</B> (<B>write</B>)
</DL>
<P><LI>Three defined users and groups (UFS) versus many (AFS)
<P>UFS controls access for one user and two groups by providing a set of mode
bits for each: the user who owns the file or directory, a single defined
group, and everyone who has an account on the system.
<P>AFS, in contrast, allows you to place many entries (individual users or
groups) on an ACL, granting a different set of access permissions to each
one. The number of possible entries is about 20, and depends on how
much space each entry occupies in the memory allocated for the ACL
itself.
<P>AFS defines two system groups, <B>system:anyuser</B> and
<B>system:authuser</B>, which represent all users and all
authenticated users, respectively; for further discussion, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ571">Using Groups on ACLs</A>. In addition, users can define their own groups in
the Protection Database, consisting of individual users or machine IP
addresses. Users who have the <B>a</B> permission on an ACL can
create entries for the system groups as well as groups defined by themselves
or other users. For information on defining groups, see <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ531">Administering the Protection Database</A>.
<P>When a user requests access to a file or directory, the File Server sums
together all of the permissions that the relevant ACL extends to the user and
to groups to which the user belongs. Placing group entries on ACLs
therefore can control access for many more users than the ACL can accommodate
as individual entries.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ567" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_632">The AFS ACL Permissions</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX8022"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8023"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8024"></A>
<P>Functionally, the seven standard ACL permissions fall into two
groups: one that applies to the directory itself and one that applies to
the files it contains.
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ568">The Four Directory Permissions</A></H4>
<P>The four permissions in this group are meaningful with
respect to the directory itself. For example, the <B>i</B>
(<B>insert</B>) permission does not control addition of data to a file,
but rather creation of a new file or subdirectory.
<DL>
<P><DT><B>The l (lookup) permission
</B><DD>This permission functions as something of a gate keeper for access to the
directory and its files, because a user must have it in order to exercise any
other permissions. In particular, a user must have this permission to
access anything in the directory's subdirectories, even if the ACL on a
subdirectory grants extensive permissions.
<A NAME="IDX8025"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8026"></A>
<P>This permission enables a user to issue the following commands:
<UL>
<P><LI>The <B>ls</B> command to list the names of the files and
subdirectories in the directory
<P><LI>The <B>ls -ld</B> command to obtain complete status information for
the directory element itself
<P><LI>The <B>fs listacl</B> command to examine the directory's ACL
</UL>
<P>This permission does not enable a user to read the contents of a file in
the directory, to issue the <B>ls -l</B> command on a file in the
directory, or to issue the <B>fs listacl</B> command with the filename as
the <B>-path</B> argument. Those operations require the
<B>r</B> (<B>read</B>) permission which is described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ569">The Three File Permissions</A>.
<P>Similarly, this permission does not enable a user to issue the
<B>ls</B>, <B>ls -l</B>, <B>ls -ld</B>, or <B>fs listacl</B>
commands against a subdirectory of the directory. Those operations
require the <B>l</B> permission on the ACL of the subdirectory
itself.
<P><DT><B>The i (insert) permission
</B><DD>This permission enables a user to add new files to the directory, either
by creating or copying, and to create new subdirectories. It does not
extend into any subdirectories, which are protected by their own ACLs.
<A NAME="IDX8027"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8028"></A>
<P><DT><B>The d (delete) permission
</B><DD>This permission enables a user to remove files and subdirectories from the
directory or move them into other directories (assuming that the user has the
<B>i</B> permission on the ACL of the other directories).
<A NAME="IDX8029"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8030"></A>
<P><DT><B>The a (administer) permission
</B><DD>This permission enables a user to change the directory's ACL.
Members of the <B>system:administrators</B> group implicitly have
this permission on every directory (that is, even if that group does not
appear on the ACL). Similarly, the owner of a directory implicitly has
this permission on its ACL and those of all directories below it that he or
she owns.

</DL>
<P><H4><A NAME="HDRWQ569">The Three File Permissions</A></H4>
<P>The three permissions in this group are meaningful with
respect to files in a directory, rather than the directory itself or its
subdirectories.
<DL>
<P><DT><B>The r (read) permission
</B><DD>This permission enables a user to read the contents of files in the
directory and to issue the <B>ls -l</B> command to stat the file
elements.
<A NAME="IDX8033"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8034"></A>
<P><DT><B>The w (write) permission

bits.
<A NAME="IDX8035"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8036"></A>
<P><DT><B>The k (lock) permission

to lock files in the directory.

</DL>
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_635">The Eight Auxiliary Permissions</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX8039"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8040"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8041"></A>
<P>AFS provides eight additional permissions that do not have a defined
meaning, denoted by the uppercase letters <B>A</B>, <B>B</B>,
<B>C</B>, <B>D</B>, <B>E</B>, <B>F</B>, <B>G</B>, and
<B>H</B>.
<P>You can write application programs that assign a meaning to one or more of
the permissions, and then place them on ACLs to control file access by those
programs. For example, you can modify a print program to recognize and
interpret the permissions, and then place them on directories that house files
that the program accesses. Use the <B>fs listacl</B> and <B>fs
setacl</B> commands to display and set the auxiliary permissions on ACLs
just like the standard seven.
<P><H4><A NAME="Header_636">Shorthand Notation for Sets of Permissions</A></H4>
<A NAME="IDX8042"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8043"></A>
<P>You can combine the seven permissions in any way in an ACL entry, but
certain combinations are more useful than others. Four of the more
common combinations have corresponding shorthand forms. When using the
<B>fs setacl</B> command to define ACL entries, you can provide either one
or more of the individual letters that represent the permissions, or one of
the following shorthand forms:
<DL>
<A NAME="IDX8044"></A>
<P><DT><B>all
</B><DD>Represents all seven standard permissions (<B>rlidwka</B>).
<A NAME="IDX8045"></A>
<P><DT><B>none
</B><DD>Removes the entry from the ACL, leaving the user or group with no
permissions.
<A NAME="IDX8046"></A>
<P><DT><B>read
</B><DD>Represents the <B>r</B> (<B>read</B>) and <B>l</B>
(<B>lookup</B>) permissions.
<A NAME="IDX8047"></A>
<P><DT><B>write
</B><DD>Represents all permissions except <B>a</B>
(<B>administer</B>): <B>rlidwk</B>.

<A NAME="IDX8048"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8049"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8050"></A>
<P>ACLs enable you both to grant and to deny access to a directory and the
files in it. To grant access, use the <B>fs setacl</B> command to
create an ACL entry that associates a set of permissions with a user or group,
as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ573">Setting ACL Entries</A>. When you use the <B>fs listacl</B> command to
display an ACL (as described in <A HREF="#HDRWQ572">Displaying ACLs</A>), such entries appear underneath the following header, which
uses the term <I>rights</I> to refer to permissions:
<PRE>   Normal rights
</PRE>
<P>There are two ways to deny access:
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>The recommended method is simply to omit an entry for the user or group
from the ACL, or to omit the appropriate permissions from the entry.
Use the <B>fs setacl</B> command to remove or edit an existing entry,
using the instructions in <A HREF="#HDRWQ574">To add, remove, or edit normal ACL permissions</A>. In most circumstances, this method is enough to
prevent access of certain kinds or by certain users. You must take
care, however, not to grant the undesired permissions to any groups to which
such users belong.
<P><LI>The more explicit method for denying access is to use the
<B>-negative</B> flag to the <B>fs setacl</B> command to create an
entry that associates <I>negative permissions</I> with the user or
group; for instructions, see <A HREF="#HDRWQ575">To add, remove, or edit negative ACL permissions</A>. The output from the <B>fs listacl</B>
command lists negative entries underneath the following header: 
<PRE>   Negative rights
</PRE> 
<P>When determining what type of access to grant to a user, the File Server
first compiles a set of permissions by examining all of the entries in the
<TT>Normal rights</TT> section of the ACL. It then subtracts any
permissions associated with the user (or with groups to which the user
belongs) on the <TT>Negative rights</TT> section of the ACL.
Therefore, negative permissions always cancel out normal permissions.
<P>Using negative permissions reverses the usual semantics of the <B>fs
setacl</B> command, introducing the potential for confusion. In
particular, combining the <B>none</B> shorthand and the
<B>-negative</B> flag constitutes a double negative: by removing an
entry from the <TT>Negative rights</TT> section of the ACL, you enable a
user once again to obtain permissions via entries in the <TT>Normal
rights</TT> section. Combining the <B>all</B> shorthand with the
<B>-negative</B> flag explicitly denies all permissions.
<P>Note also that it is pointless to create an entry in the <TT>Negative
rights</TT> section if an entry in the <TT>Normal rights</TT> section
grants the denied permissions to the <B>system:anyuser</B>
group. In this case, users can obtain the permissions simply by using
the <B>unlog</B> command to discard their tokens. When they do so,
the File Server recognizes them as the <B>anonymous</B> user, who belongs
to the <B>system:anyuser</B> group but does not match the entries on
the <TT>Negative rights</TT> section of the ACL.
</OL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRWQ571" HREF="auagd002.htm#ToC_638">Using Groups on ACLs</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX8051"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8052"></A>
<P>As previously mentioned, placing a group entry on an ACL enables you to
control access for many users at once. You can grant a new user access
to many files and directories simply by adding the user to a group that
appears on the relevant ACLs. You can also create groups of machines,
in which case any user logged on to the machine obtains the access that is
granted to the group. On directories where they have the <B>a</B>
permission on the ACL, users can define their own groups and can create ACL
entries for any groups, not just groups that they create or own
themselves. For instructions on creating groups of users or machines,
and a discussion of the most effective ways to use different types of groups,
see <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ531">Administering the Protection Database</A>.

<A NAME="IDX8055"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8056"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8057"></A>
<P>AFS also defines the following two system groups, which can be very useful
on ACLs because they potentially represent a large group of people. For
more information about these groups, see <A HREF="auagd019.htm#HDRWQ535">The System Groups</A>.
<DL>
<P><DT><B>system:anyuser
</B><DD>Includes anyone who can access the cell's file tree, including users
who have logged in as the local superuser <B>root</B>, have connected to a
local machine from somewhere outside the cell, and AFS users who belong to a
foreign cell. This group includes users who do not have tokens that are
valid for the local AFS servers; the servers recognize them as the user
<B>anonymous</B>.
<P>Note that creating an ACL entry for this group is the only way to extend
access to AFS users from foreign cells, unless you create local authentication
accounts for them.
<A NAME="IDX8058"></A>
<P><DT><B>system:authuser
</B><DD>Includes all users who have a valid AFS token obtained from the local
cell's authentication service.
</DL>
<P>It is particularly useful to grant the <B>l</B> (<B>lookup</B>)
permission to the <B>system:anyuser</B> group on the ACL of most
directories in the file system, especially at the upper levels. This
permission enables users only to learn the names of files and subdirectories
in a directory, but without it they cannot traverse their way through the
directories in the path to a target file.
<P>A slightly more restrictive alternative is to grant the <B>l</B>
permission to the <B>system:authuser</B> group. If that is
still not restrictive enough, you can grant the <B>l</B> to specific users
or groups, which cannot exceed about 20 in number on a given ACL.
<P>Another reason to grant certain permissions to the
<B>system:anyuser</B> group is to enable the correct operation of
processes that provide services such as printing and mail delivery. For
example, in addition to the <B>l</B> permission, a print process possibly
needs the <B>r</B> (<B>read</B>) permission in order to access the
contents of files, and a mail delivery process possibly requires the
<B>i</B> (<B>insert</B>) permission to deliver new pieces of
mail.
<P>The ACL on the root directory of every newly created volume grants all
permissions to the <B>system:administrators</B> group. You
can remove this entry if you wish, but members of the
<B>system:administrators</B> group always implicitly have the
<B>a</B> (<B>administer</B>), and by default also the <B>l</B>,
permission on every directory's ACL. The <B>a</B> permission
enables them to grant themselves other permissions explicitly when
necessary. To learn about changing this default set of permissions, see
<A HREF="auagd021.htm#HDRWQ586">Administering the system:administrators Group</A>.

<A NAME="IDX8059"></A>
<A NAME="IDX8060"></A>
<P>To display the ACL associated with a file, directory or symbolic link,
issue the <B>fs listacl</B> command. The output for a symbolic link
displays the ACL that applies to its target file or directory, rather than the
ACL on the directory that houses the symbolic link.
<P><B>Note for AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit users:</B> If the machine
on which you issue the <B>fs listacl</B> command is configured to access a
DCE cell's DFS filespace via the AFS/DFS Migration Toolkit, you can use
the command to display the ACL on DFS files and directories. To display
a DFS directory's Initial Container and Initial Object ACL instead of the
regular one, include the <B>fs listacl</B> command's <B>-id</B>
or <B>-if</B> flag. For instructions, see the <I>IBM AFS/DFS
Migration Toolkit Administration Guide and Reference</I>. The
<B>fs</B> command interpreter ignores the <B>-id</B> and
<B>-if</B> flags if you include them when displaying an AFS ACL.

<P>Although AFS uses ACLs to protect file data rather than the mode bits that
UFS uses, it does not ignore the mode bits entirely. When you issue the
<B>chmod</B> command on an AFS file or directory, AFS changes the bits
appropriately. To change a file's mode bits, you must have the AFS
<B>w</B> (<B>write</B>) permission on the ACL of the file's
directory. To change a directory's mode bits, you must have the
<B>d</B> (<B>delete</B>), <B>i</B> (<B>insert</B>), and
<B>l</B> (<B>lookup</B>) permissions on its ACL.
<P>AFS also uses the UNIX mode bits as follows:
<UL>
<P><LI>It uses the initial bit to determine the element's type. This
is the bit that appears first in the output from the <B>ls -l</B> command
and shows the hyphen (<B>-</B>) for a file or the letter <B>d</B> for
a directory.
<P><LI>It does not use any of the mode bits on a directory.
<P><LI>For a file, the first (owner) set of bits interacts with the ACL entries
that apply to the file in the following way:
<UL>
<P><LI>If the first <B>r</B> mode bit is not set, no one (including the
owner) can read the file, no matter what permissions they have on the
ACL. If the bit is set, users also need the <B>r</B>
(<B>read</B>) and <B>l</B> permissions on the ACL of the file's
directory to read the file.
<P><LI>If the first <B>w</B> mode bit is not set, no one (including the
owner) can modify the file. If the <B>w</B> bit is set, users also
need the <B>w</B> and <B>l</B> permissions on the ACL of the
file's directory to modify the file.
<P><LI>There is no ACL permission directly corresponding to the <B>x</B> mode
bit, but to execute a file stored in AFS, the user must also have the
