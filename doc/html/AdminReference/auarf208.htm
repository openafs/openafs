<P><STRONG>Purpose</STRONG>
<P>Creates a new PAG
<P><STRONG>Synopsis</STRONG>
<PRE><B>pagsh</B>
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>pagsh</B> command creates a new command shell (owned by the
issuer of the command) and associates a new <I>process authentication
group</I> (PAG) with the shell and the user. A PAG is a number
guaranteed to identify the issuer of commands in the new shell uniquely to the
local Cache Manager. The PAG is used, instead of the issuer's UNIX
UID, to identify the issuer in the credential structure that the Cache Manager
creates to track each user.
<P>Any tokens acquired subsequently (presumably for other cells) become
associated with the PAG, rather than with the user's UNIX UID.
This method for distinguishing users has two advantages.
<UL>
<P><LI>It means that processes spawned by the user inherit the PAG and so share
the token; thus they gain access to AFS as the authenticated user.
In many environments, for example, printer and other daemons run under
identities (such as the local superuser <B>root</B>) that the AFS server
processes recognize only as <B>anonymous</B>. Unless PAGs are used,
such daemons cannot access files in directories whose access control lists
(ACLs) do not extend permissions to the <B>system:anyuser</B>
group.
<P><LI>It closes a potential security loophole: UNIX allows anyone already
logged in as the local superuser <B>root</B> on a machine to assume any
other identity by issuing the UNIX <B>su</B> command. If the
credential structure is identified by a UNIX UID rather than a PAG, then the
local superuser <B>root</B> can assume a UNIX UID and use any tokens
associated with that UID. Use of a PAG as an identifier eliminates that
possibility.
</UL>
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">The <B>pagsh.krb</B> version of this command is intended for use
by sites that employ standard Kerberos authentication for their
clients. The <B>pagsh.krb</B> command provides all the
functionality of the <B>pagsh</B> command. In addition, it defines
the environment variable KRBTKFILE (which specifies the storage location of
Kerberos tickets) to be the <B>/tmp/tktp</B><VAR>X</VAR> file (where
<VAR>X</VAR> is the number of the user's PAG). The functionality of
this command supports the placement of Kerberos tickets by the
<B>klog.krb</B> command and Kerberized AFS-modified login utilities
in the file specified by the environment variable KRBTKFILE.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>Each PAG created uses two of the memory slots that the kernel uses to
record the UNIX groups associated with a user. If none of these slots
are available, the <B>pagsh</B> command fails. This is not a
problem with most operating systems, which make at least 16 slots available
per user.
<P>In cells that do not use an AFS-modified login utility, use this command to
obtain a PAG before issuing the <B>klog</B> command (or include the
<B>-setpag</B> argument to the <B>klog</B> command). If a PAG
is not acquired, the Cache Manager stores the token in a credential structure
identified by local UID rather than PAG. This creates the potential
security exposure described in the <B>Description</B> section.
<P>If users of NFS client machines for which AFS is supported are to issue
this command as part of authenticating with AFS, do not use the <B>fs
exportafs</B> command's <B>-uidcheck on</B> argument to enable UID
checking on NFS/AFS Translator machines. Enabling UID checking prevents
this command from succeeding. See the reference page for the
<B>klog</B> command.
<P>If UID checking is not enabled on Translator machines, then by default it
is possible to issue this command on a properly configured NFS client machine
that is accessing AFS via the NFS/AFS Translator, assuming that the NFS client
machine is a supported system type. The <B>pagsh</B> binary
accessed by the NFS client must be owned by, and grant setuid privilege to,
the local superuser <B>root</B>. The complete set of mode bits must
be <B>-rwsr-xr-x</B>. This is not a requirement when the command is
issued on AFS client machines.
<P>However, if the translator machine's administrator has enabled UID
checking by including the <B>-uidcheck on</B> argument to the <B>fs
exportafs</B> command, the command fails with an error message similar to
the following:
<PRE>   
   Warning: Remote setpag to <VAR>translator_machine</VAR>  has failed (err=8). . . 
   setpag: Exec format error
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>In the following example, the issuer invokes the C shell instead of the
default Bourne shell:
<PRE>   # <B>pagsh -c /bin/csh</B>
