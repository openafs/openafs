<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<P>The <B>backup diskrestore</B> command restores all of the volumes for
which the Volume Location Database (VLDB) lists a read/write site on the
partition specified with the <B>-server</B> and <B>-partition</B>
arguments. It is useful if a disk or machine failure corrupts or
destroys the data on an entire partition. (To restore any read-only or
backup volumes that resided on the partition, use the <B>vos release</B>
and <B>vos backup</B> commands, respectively, after restoring the
read/write version.)
<P>If restoring only selected volumes to a single site, it is usually more
efficient to use the <B>backup volrestore</B> command. To restore
multiple volumes to many different sites, use the <B>backup
volsetrestore</B> command.
<P>(If the <B>FILE YES</B> instruction appears in the
<B>/usr/afs/backup/CFG_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file on the Tape
Coordinator machine associated with the specified port offset, then the Backup
System restores data from the backup data file listed for that port offset in
the Tape Coordinator's <B>/usr/afs/backup/tapeconfig</B> file,
instead of from tape. For the sake of clarity, the following text
refers to tapes only, but the Backup System handles backup data files in much
the same way.)
<P>The Backup System determines whether the read/write or backup version of
each volume was dumped more recently, and restores the dumps of that version,
starting with the most recent full dump. It resets the creation
timestamp of each restored volume to the date and time at which it begins
restoring the volume (the creation timestamp appears in the
<TT>Creation</TT> field of the output from the <B>vos examine</B> and
<B>vos listvol</B> commands).
<P>If all of the full and incremental dumps of all relevant volumes were not
written on compatible tape devices, use the <B>-portoffset</B> argument to
list multiple port offset numbers in the order in which the tapes are needed
(first list the port offset for the full dump, second the port offset for the
level 1 incremental dump, and so on). This implies that the full dumps
of all relevant volumes must have been written to a type of tape that the
first Tape Coordinator can read, the level 1 incremental dumps to a type of
tape the second Tape Coordinator can read, and so on. If dumps are on
multiple incompatible tape types, use the <B>backup volrestore</B> command
to restore individual volumes, or the <B>backup volsetrestore</B> command
after defining groups of volumes that were dumped to compatible tape
types. For further discussion, see the <I>IBM AFS Administration
Guide</I>.
<P>By default, the Backup System restores the contents of the specified
partition to that same partition. To restore the contents to an
alternate site, combine the following options as indicated. The Backup
System removes each volume from the original site, if it still exists, and
records the change of site in the VLDB.
<UL>
<P><LI>To restore to a different partition on the same file server machine,
provide the <B>-newpartition</B> argument.
<P><LI>To restore to the partition with the same name on a different file server
machine, provide the <B>-newserver</B> argument.
<P><LI>To restore to a completely different site, combine the
<B>-newserver</B> and <B>-newpartition</B> arguments.
</UL>
<P>By default, the Backup System overwrites the contents of existing volumes
with the restored data. To create a new volume to house the restored
data instead, use the <B>-extension</B> argument. The Backup System
creates the new volume at the site designated by the <B>-newserver</B> and
<B>-newpartition</B> arguments if they are used or the <B>-server</B>
and <B>-partition</B> arguments otherwise. It derives the volume
name by adding the extension to the read/write base name listed in the VLDB,
and creates a new VLDB entry. The command does not affect the existing
volume in any way. However, if a volume with the specified extension
also already exists, the command overwrites it.
<P>To print out a list of the tapes containing the needed dumps, without
actually performing the restore operation, include the <B>-n</B> flag
along with the other options to be used on the actual command.
<P>The Tape Coordinator's default response to this command is to access
the first tape it needs by invoking the <B>MOUNT</B> instruction in the
local <B>CFG_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file, or by prompting the backup
operator to insert the tape if there is no <B>MOUNT</B>
instruction. However, if the <B>AUTOQUERY NO</B> instruction
appears in the <B>CFG_</B><VAR>device_name</VAR> file, or if the issuer of
the <B>butc</B> command included the <B>-noautoquery</B> flag, the
Tape Coordinator instead expects the tape to be in the device already.
If it is not, or is the wrong tape, the Tape Coordinator invokes the
<B>MOUNT</B> instruction or prompts the operator. It also invokes
the <B>MOUNT</B> instruction or prompts for any additional tapes needed to
complete the restore operation; the backup operator must arrange to
provide them.
<P><STRONG>Cautions</STRONG>
<P>If issuing this command to recover data after a disk crash or other damage,
be sure not to issue the <B>vos syncserv</B> command first. Doing
so destroys the VLDB record of the volumes that resided on the
partition.
<P><STRONG>Options</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><B>-server
</B><DD>Names the file server machine that the VLDB lists as the site of the
volumes that need to be restored.
<P><DT><B>-partition
</B><DD>Names the partition that the VLDB lists as the site of the volumes that
need to be restored.
<P><DT><B>-portoffset
</B><DD>Specifies one or more port offset numbers (up to a maximum of 128), each
corresponding to a Tape Coordinator to use in the operation. If there
is more than one value, the Backup System uses the first one when restoring
the full dump of each volume, the second one when restoring the level 1
incremental dump of each volume, and so on. It uses the final value in
the list when restoring dumps at the corresponding depth in the dump hierarchy
and at all lower levels.
<P>Provide this argument unless the default value of 0 (zero) is appropriate
for all dumps. If <B>0</B> is just one of the values in the list,
provide it explicitly in the appropriate order.
<P><DT><B>-newserver
</B><DD>Names an alternate file server machine to which to restore the
volumes. If this argument is omitted, the volumes are restored to the
file server machine named by the <B>-server</B> argument.
<P><DT><B>-newpartition
</B><DD>Names an alternate partition to which to restore the data. If this
argument is omitted, the volumes are restored to the partition named by the
<B>-partition</B> argument.
<P><DT><B>-extension
</B><DD>Creates a new volume for each volume being restored, to house the restored
data. The Backup System derives the new volume's name by appending
the specified string to the read/write base name listed in the VLDB, and
creates a new VLDB volume entry. The Backup System preserves the
contents of the volumes on the partition, if any still exist. Any
string other than <B>.readonly</B> or <B>.backup</B> is
acceptable, but the combination of the base name and extension cannot exceed
22 characters in length. To use a period to separate the extension from
the name, specify it as the first character of the string (as in
<B>.rst</B>, for example).
<P><DT><B>-n
</B><DD>Displays a list of the tapes necessary to perform the requested restore,
without actually performing the operation.
<P><DT><B>-localauth
</B><DD>Constructs a server ticket using a key from the local
<B>/usr/afs/etc/KeyFile</B> file. The <B>backup</B> command
interpreter presents it to the Backup Server, Volume Server and VL Server
during mutual authentication. Do not combine this flag with the
<B>-cell</B> argument. For more details, see the introductory
<B>backup</B> reference page.
<P><DT><B>-cell
</B><DD>Names the cell in which to run the command. Do not combine this
argument with the <B>-localauth</B> flag. For more details, see the
introductory <B>backup</B> reference page.
<P><DT><B>-help
</B><DD>Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options
are ignored.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Output</STRONG>
<P>If a tape error occurs during the restore operation, the Tape Coordinator
displays the following messages:
<PRE>   Restore operation on volume <VAR>name</VAR> failed due to tape error
   Do you want to continue (y/n)?
   
</PRE>
<P>where <VAR>name</VAR> is the name of the volume that was being restored when
the tape error occurred. Enter the value <B>y</B> to continue the
operation without restoring the indicated volume or the value <B>n</B> to
terminate the operation. In the latter case, the operator can then
attempt to determine the cause of the tape error.
<P>If the issuer includes the <B>-n</B> flag with the command, the
following string appears at the head of the list of the tapes necessary to
perform the restore operation:
<PRE>   Tapes needed:
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P>The following command restores the volumes for which the VLDB lists a
read/write site on the <B>/vicepd</B> partition of the machine
<B>fs5.abc.com</B>. The Tape Coordinator associated
with port offset 3 performs the operation.
<PRE>   % <B>backup diskrestore -server fs5.abc.com -partition /vicepd -portoffset 3</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>The following command restores the volumes for which the VLDB lists a
read/write site on the <B>/vicepb</B> partition of the machine
<B>fs1.abc.com</B> to a new site: the
<B>/vicepa</B> partition on the machine
<B>fs3.abc.com</B>. The Tape Coordinator associated
with port offset 0 performs the operation. (The command appears here on
two lines only for legibility.)
<PRE>   % <B>backup diskrestore  -server fs1.abc.com -partition /vicepb</B>   \
                         <B>-newserver fs3.abc.com -newpartition /vicepa</B>
   
</PRE>
<P>The following command lists the tapes required to restore the volumes for
which the VLDB lists a read/write site on the <B>/vicepm</B> partition of
the machine <B>fs4.abc.com</B>:
<PRE>   % <B>backup diskrestore -server fs4.abc.com -partition /vicepm -n</B>
   Tapes needed:
   user.sunday1.1
   user.sunday1.2
   user.monday1.1
   user.tuesday1.1
   user.wednesday1.1
   
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Privilege Required</STRONG>
<P>The issuer must be listed in the <B>/usr/afs/etc/UserList</B> file on
every machine where the Backup Server or Volume Location (VL) Server is
running, and on every file server machine that houses an affected
volume. If the <B>-localauth</B> flag is included, the issuer must
instead be logged on to a server machine as the local superuser
<B>root</B>.
