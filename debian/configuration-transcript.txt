This is a transcript of a user following the instructions in
README.servers.  It is best read side-by-side with that documentation
while you are setting up your cell.

This transcript includes creation of a loopback mount on /vicepa using
file full of zeros.  This is useful to know how to do because it allows
you to test an AFS server without repartitioning.  However, for production
cells, you should repartition and create a /vicepa partition.

Thanks to Faheem Mitha for the transcript.

Configuring krb5-config
-----------------------

   When users attempt to use Kerberos and specify a principal or user
   name without specifying what administrative Kerberos realm that
   principal belongs to, the system appends the default realm.
   Normally default realm is the upper case version of the local DNS
   domain.

What is the default Kerberos version 5 realm? DULCI.BIOSTAT.DUKE.EDU


Configuring krb5-kdc
--------------------

By default, Kerberos4 requests are allowed from principals that do not
require preauthentication.  This allows Kerberos4 services to exist
while requiring most users to use Kerberos5 clients to get their
initial tickets.  These tickets can then be converted to Kerberos4
tickets. Alternatively, the mode can be set to full, allowing
Kerberos4 to get initial tickets even when preauthentication would
normally be required, or to disable, which will disable all Kerberos4
support.

   1. disable  2. full  3. nopreauth  4. none

Kerberos4 compatibility mode to use: 3

Configuring krb5-admin-server
-----------------------------

Setting up a Kerberos Realm

This package contains the administrative tools necessary to run on the
Kerberos master server.  However, installing this package does not
automatically set up a Kerberos realm.  Doing so requires entering
passwords and as such is not well-suited for package installation.  To
create the realm, run the krb5_newrealm command. You may also wish to
read /usr/share/doc/krb5-kdc/README.KDC and the administration guide
found in the krb5-doc package.

Don't forget to set up DNS information so your clients can find your
KDC and admin servers.  Doing so is documented in the administration
guide.

This script should be run on the master KDC/admin server to initialize

This password will be used to generate a key that is stored in
/etc/krb5kdc/stash.  You should try to remember this password, but it
is much more important that it be a strong password than that it be
remembered.  However, if you lose the password and /etc/krb5kdc/stash,
you cannot decrypt your Kerberos database.

Now that your realm is set up you may wish to create an administrative

Then, this principal can be added to /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl so that
you can use the kadmin program on other computers.  Kerberos admin
principals usually belong to a single user and end in /admin.  For
example, if jruser is a Kerberos administrator, then in addition to
the normal jruser principal, a jruser/admin principal should be
created.

Don't forget to set up DNS information so your clients can find your
KDC and admin servers.  Doing so is documented in the administration

Configuring openafs-client
--------------------------

AFS filespace is organized into cells or administrative domains. Each
workstation belongs to one cell.  Usually the cell is the DNS domain
name of the site.

What AFS cell does this workstation belong to? dulci.biostat.duke.edu

AFS uses an area of the disk to cache remote files for faster access.
This cache will be mounted on /var/cache/openafs.  It is important
that the cache not overfill the partition it is located on.  Often,
people find it useful to dedicate a partition to their AFS cache.

How large is your AFS cache (kB)? 50000

/afs generally contains an entry for each cell that a client can talk
to. Traditionally, these entries were generated by servers in the
client's home cell.  However, OpenAFS clients can generate the
contents of /afs dynamically based on the contents of
/etc/openafs/CellServDB and DNS.

If you generate /afs dynamically, you may need to create
/etc/openafs/CellAlias to include aliases for common cells. DO NOT
SELECT THIS OPTION IF THIS MACHINE IS THE FIRST DATABASE SERVER IN A
NEW CELL .

Dynamically generate the contents of /afs? no

Configuring openafs-client
--------------------------

AFS uses the file /etc/openafs/CellServDB to hold the list of servers
that should be contacted to find parts of a cell.  The cell you claim
this workstation belongs to is not in that file.  Enter the host names
of the database servers separated by spaces.  IMPORTANT: If you are
creating a new cell and this machine is to be a database server in
that cell, only enter this machine's name; add the other servers later
after they are functioning. Also, do not enable the AFS client to
start at boot on this server until the cell is configured.  When you
are ready you can edit /etc/openafs/afs.conf.client to enable the
client.

What hosts are DB servers for your home cell? riverside.dulci.biostat.duke.edu

Should the Openafs filesystem be started and mounted at boot?
Normally, most users who install the openafs-client package expect to
run it at boot.  However, if you are planning on setting up a new cell
or are on a laptop, you may not want it started at boot time. If you
choose not to start AFS at boot , run /etc/init.d/openafs-client
force-start to start the client when you wish to run it.

Run Openafs client now and at boot? no

                             Prerequisites

In order to set up a new AFS cell, you must meet the following:

1) You need a working Kerberos realm with Kerberos4 support.  You
    should install Heimdal with Kth-kerberos compatibility or MIT
    Kerberos5.

2) You need to create the single-DES AFS key and load it into
    /etc/openafs/server/KeyFile.  If your cell's name is the same as
    your Kerberos realm then create a principal called afs.  Otherwise,
    create a principal called afs/cellname in your realm.  The cell
    name should be all lower case, unlike Kerberos realms which are all
    upper case.  You can use asetkey from the openafs-krb5 package, or
    if you used AFS3 salt to create the key, the bos addkey command.

3) This machine should have a filesystem mounted on /vicepa.  If you
    do not have a free partition, then create a large file by using dd
    to extract bytes from /dev/zero.  Create a filesystem on this file
    and mount it using -oloop.

4) You will need an administrative principal created in a Kerberos
    realm.  This principal will be added to susers and
    system:administrators and thus will be able to run administrative
    commands.  Generally the user is a root or admin instance of some
    administrative user.  For example if jruser is an administrator then
    it would be reasonable to create jruser/root (or jruser/admin) and
    specify that as the user to be added in this script.

5) The AFS client must not be running on this workstation.  It will be
    at the end of this script.

Do you meet these requirements? [y/n] y
If the fileserver is not running, this may hang for 30 seconds.

                             Prerequisites

In order to set up the root.afs volume, you must meet the following
pre-conditions:

1) The cell must be configured, running a database server with a
    volume location and protection server.  The afs-newcell script will
    set up these services.

2) You must be logged into the cell with tokens in for a user in
    system:administrators and with a principal that is in the UserList
    file of the servers in the cell.

3) You need a fileserver in the cell with partitions mounted and a
    root.afs volume created.  Presumably, it has no volumes on it,
    although the script will work so long as nothing besides root.afs
    exists.  The afs-newcell script will set up the file server.

4) The AFS client must be running pointed at the new cell.
Do you meet these conditions? (y/n) y

You will need to select a server (hostname) and AFS partition on which to
create the root volumes.
