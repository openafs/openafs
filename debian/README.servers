                    Setting up a Debian OpenAFS Server

Introduction

  This document describes how to set up an OpenAFS server using the Debian
  packages.  If you are not already familiar with the basic concepts of
  OpenAFS, you should review the documentation at:

      <http://www.openafs.org/doc/index.htm>

  particularly the AFS Administrator's Guide.  This documentation is
  somewhat out of date (it doesn't talk about how to use a Kerberos v5 KDC
  instead of the AFS kaserver, for example), but it's a good introduction
  to the basic concepts and servers you will need to run.

  The Debian OpenAFS packages follow the FHS and therefore use different
  paths than the standard AFS documentation or the paths that experienced
  AFS administrators may be used to.  In the first column below are the
  traditional paths, and in the second column, the Debian paths:

      /usr/afs/etc        /etc/openafs/server
      /usr/afs/local      /etc/openafs/server-local
      /usr/afs/db         /var/lib/openafs/db
      /usr/afs/logs       /var/log/openafs
      /usr/afs/bin        /usr/lib/openafs
      /usr/vice/etc       /etc/openafs

  The AFS kaserver (a Kerberos v4 KDC) is not packaged for Debian.  Any
  new OpenAFS installation should use Kerberos v5 for authentication in
  conjunction with either the tools packaged in the openafs-krb5 package
  or the Heimdal KDC.  When setting up a new cell, you should therefore
  not set up a kaserver as described in the AFS Administrator's Guide, and
  you will need to follow a slightly different method of setting the cell
  key.

Creating a New Cell

  For documentation on adding a server to an existing cell, see below.

  These instructions assume that you are using MIT Kerberos and the
  openafs-krb5 package.  If you are using Heimdal instead, some of the
  steps will be slightly different (Heimdal can write the AFS KeyFile
  directly, for example, so you don't have to use asetkey).  The
  afs-newcell and afs-rootvol scripts are the same, however.

  /usr/share/doc/openafs-dbserver/configuration-transcript.txt.gz has a
  transcript of the results of these directions, which you may want to
  follow along with as you do this.

  1.  If you do not already have a Kerberos KDC (Key Distribution Center,
      the daemon that handles Kerberos authentication) configured, do so.
      You can run the KDC on the same system as your OpenAFS db server,
      although if you plan on using Kerberos for other things, you may
      eventually want to use separate systems.  If you do not have a
      Kerberos realm set up already, you can do so in Debian with:

          apt-get install krb5-admin-server
          krb5_newrealm

      This will install a KDC and kadmind server (the server that handles
      password changes and account creations) on the local system.  Please
      be aware that the security of everything that uses Kerberos for
      authentication, including AFS, depends on the security of the KDC.

      The name of your Kerberos realm should, for various reasons, be in
      all uppercase and be a domain name that you control, although
      neither is technically required.

      Right now, for the aklog from openafs-krb5 to work, you need to
      enable krb4 support (either full or preauth) and run krb524d.
      Eventually this will no longer be necessary.

  2.  It is traditional (and recommended) in AFS (and for Kerberos) to
      give administrators two separate Kerberos principals, one regular
      principal to use for regular purposes and a separate admin principal
      to use for privileged actions.  This is similar to the distinction
      between a regular user and the root user in Unix, except that
      everyone can have their own separate root identity.  Kerberos
      recommends username/admin as the admin principal for username, and
      this will work for AFS as well.

      If you have not already created such an admin principal for yourself
      in your Kerberos realm, do so now (using kadmin.local on your KDC,
      unless you have a local method that you prefer).  Also create a
      regular (non-admin) principal for yourself if you have not already;
      this is the identity that you'll use for regular operations, like
      storing files or reading mail.

      If the KDC is not on the same system that the OpenAFS db server will
      be on, you will also need to give your admin principal the rights to
      download the afs keytab in /etc/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl by adding a lines
      like:

          username/admin@REALM    *

      where REALM is your Kerberos realm and username/admin is the admin
      principal that you created.  That line gives you full admin access
      to the Kerberos v5 realm.  You can be more restrictive if you want;
      see the kadmind man page for the syntax.

  3.  Install the OpenAFS db server package on an appropriate system with:

          apt-get install openafs-dbserver openafs-krb5

      The openafs-krb5 package will be used to create the AFS KeyFile.

      As part of this installation, you will need to configure
      openafs-client with the cell you are creating as the local cell name
      and the server on which you're working as the db server.  This name
      is technically arbitrary but should, for various reasons, be a valid
      domain name that you control; unlike Kerberos realms, it should be
      in all lowercase.  Enter the name of the local system when prompted
      for the names of your OpenAFS db servers.  Don't start the client;
      that will happen below.  For right now, say that you don't want it
      to start at boot.  You can change that later with dpkg-reconfigure
      openafs-client.

      If you have already installed openafs-client and configured it for
      some other cell, you do need to configure it to point to your new
      cell for these instructions to work.  Stop the AFS client on the
      system with /etc/init.d/openafs-client stop and then run:

           dpkg-reconfigure openafs-client

      pointing it to the new cell you're about to create instead.
      Remember, your cell name should be in lowercase.  If you have had to
      do this several times, double-check /etc/openafs/CellServDB when
      you're done and make sure that there is only one entry for your new
      cell at the top of that file and that it lists the correct IP
      address for your new db server.

      In order to complete the AFS installation, you will also need a
      working AFS client installed on that system, which means that you
      need to install an OpenAFS kernel module.  Please see:

          /usr/share/doc/openafs-client/README.modules

      for information on how to do that.

  4.  Create an AFS principal in Kerberos.  This is the AFS service
      principal, used by clients to authenticate to AFS and for AFS
      servers to authenticate to each other.  It *must* be a DES key; AFS
      does not support any other encryption type.  Run kadmin.local on
      your KDC and then, at the kadmin.local prompt, run:

          addprinc -randkey -e des-cbc-crc:v4 afs

      If your Kerberos realm name does not match your AFS cell name (if,
      for instance, you have one Kerberos realm with multiple AFS cells),
      use "afs/cell.name" as the name of the principal above instead of
      just "afs", where cell.name is the name of your new AFS cell.

  5.  On the db server, download this key into a keytab.  If this is the
      same system as the KDC, you can use kadmin.local again.  If not, you
      should use kadmin (make sure that krb5-user is installed), and you
      may need to pass -p username/admin to kadmin to tell it what
      principal to authenticate as.  Whichever way you get into kadmin,
      run:

          ktadd -k /tmp/afs.keytab -e des-cbc-crc:v4 afs

      (or afs/cell.name if you used that instead).  In the message that
      results, note the kvno number reported, since you'll need it later
      (it will normally be 3).

      Don't forgoet the -e des-cbc-crc:v4 to force the afs key to be DES.
      You can verify this with:

          getprinc afs

      and checking to be sure that the only key listed is a DES key.  If
      there are multiple keys listed, delprinc the afs principal, delete
      the /tmp/afs.keytab file, and then start over with addprinc, making
      sure not to forget the -e option.

  6.  Create the AFS KeyFile with:

          asetkey add <kvno> /tmp/afs.keytab afs

      (or afs/cell.name if you used that instead).  <kvno> should be
      replaced by the kvno number reported by kadmin.  This tells AFS the
      Kerberos key that it should use, making it match the key in the
      Kerberos KDC.

  7.  If the name of your Kerberos realm does not match the name of your
      AFS cell, tell AFS what Kerberos realm to use with:

          echo REALM > /etc/openafs/server/krb.conf

      where REALM is the name of your Kerberos realm.  If your AFS cell
      and Kerberos realm have the same name, this is unnecessary.

  7.  Create some space to use for AFS volumes.  You can set up a separate
      AFS file server on a different system from the Kerberos KDC and AFS
      db server, and for a larger cell you will want to do so, but when
      getting started you can make the db server a file server as well.
      For a production cell, you will want to create a separate partition
      devoted to AFS and mount it as /vicepa (and may want to make
      multiple partitions mounted as /vicepb, /vicepc, etc.), but for
      testing purposes, you can use the commands below to create a
      zero-filled file, create a file system in it, and then mount it:

          dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/openafs/vicepa bs=1024k count=32
          mke2fs /var/lib/openafs/vicepa
          mkdir /vicepa
          mount -oloop /var/lib/openafs/vicepa /vicepa

      mke2fs will ask you if you're sure you want to create a file system
      on a non-block device; say yes.

  8.  Run afs-newcell.  This will prompt you to be sure that the above
      steps have been complete and will ask you for the Kerberos principal
      to use for AFS administrative access.  You should use the
      username/admin principal discussed above.

      At the completion of this step, you should see bosserver and several
      other AFS server processes running, and you should be able to see
      the status of those procesess with:

          bos status localhost -local

      Now, you should be able to run:

          kinit username/admin@REALM
          aklog cell.name -k REALM

      where username/admin is the admin principal discussed above, REALM
      is the name of your Kerberos realm, and cell.name is the name of
      your AFS cell.  This will obtain Kerberos tickets and AFS tokens in
      your Kerberos realm and new AFS cell.  You should be able to see
      your AFS tokens by running:

          tokens

      Finally, you should be able to see the status of the AFS server
      processes with:

          bos status <hostname>

      where <hostname> is the hostname of the local system, once you've
      done the above.  This tests authenticated bos access as your admin
      principal (rather than using the local KeyFile to authenticate).

  9.  Run afs-rootvol.  This creates the basic AFS volume structure for
      your new cell.  It will prompt you to be sure that the above steps
      are complete and then will ask you what file server and partition to
      create the volume on.  If you were following the above instructions,
      use the local hostname and "a" as the partition (without the
      quotes), which will use /vicepa.

      After this command completes, you should be able to /bin/ls /afs and
      see your local cell (and, if you aren't using dynroot, mount points
      for several other cells).  Note that if you're not using dynroot,
      run /bin/ls rather than just ls to be sure that ls isn't aliased to
      ls -F, ls --color, or some other option that would stat each file in
      /afs, since this would require contacting lots of foreign cells and
      could take a very long time.

      You should now be able to cd to /afs/cell.name where cell.name is
      the AFS cell name that you used.  Currently, there isn't anything in
      your cell.  To make modifications, cd to /afs/.cell.name (note the
      leading period) and make changes there.  To make those changes show
      up at /afs/cell.name, run vos release root.cell.  For more details
      on what you can do now, see the AFS Administrator's Reference.

  10. While this is optional, you probably want to add AFSDB records to
      DNS for your new AFS cell.  These special DNS records let AFS
      clients find the db servers for your cell without requiring local
      configuration.  To do this, create a DNS record like:

          <cell>.        3600    IN      AFSDB   1 <server>.

      where <cell> is the name of your AFS cell and <server> is the name
      of your db server.  Note the trailing periods to prevent the DNS
      server from appending the origin.  You can, of course, choose what
      you prefer for the lifetime.  The 1 is not a priority; it's a
      special indicator saying that this record is for an AFS database
      server.

      If you have multiple db servers (see below for adding new ones), you
      should create multiple records of this type, one per db server.

  Congratulations!  You now have an AFS cell.  If any of the above steps
  failed, please check the steps carefully and make sure that you've done
  them all in order.  If that doesn't reveal the cause of the problem,
  please feel free to submit a bug report with reportbug.  Include as many
  details as possible on exactly what you typed and exactly what you saw
  as a result, particularly any error messages.

Adding Additional Servers

  If you decide one server is not enough, or if you're adding a server to
  an existing cell, here is roughly what you should do:

  1.  Copy securely (using scp, encrypted Kerberos rcp, or some other
      secure method) all of /etc/openafs/server to the new server.

  2.  Install the openafs-fileserver package on the new server.

  3.  If the machine is to be a file server, create an fs instance using
      bos create:

          bos create <host> fs fs -cmd /usr/lib/openafs/fileserver \
              -cmd /usr/lib/openafs/volserver \
              -cmd /usr/lib/openafs/salvager -localauth

      For a file server, this is all you have to do.

  4.  For database servers, also install openafs-dbserver and then use bos
      addhost to add the new server to /etc/openafs/server/CellServDB:

          bos addhost <server> <new-server>

      for each db server <server> in your cell (including the new one).
      Then, create ptserver and vlserver instances on the new server:

          bos create <host> ptserver simple /usr/lib/openafs/ptserver \
              -localauth
          bos create <host> vlserver simple /usr/lib/openafs/vlserver \
              -localauth

      The existing servers should then propagate the database to the new
      server.  Note that you do not need to run a file server on a db
      server if you don't want to (and larger sites probably will not want
      to), but you always need to have the openafs-fileserver package
      installed on db servers.  It contains the bosserver binary and some
      of the shared infrastructure.

  5.  If you added a new db server, configure your clients to use it.  If
      you are using AFSDB records in DNS, you can just add a new record
      (see point 10 in the instructions for creating a new cell).
      Otherwise, clients will need to have the new server IP address added
      to their /etc/openafs/CellServDB file (or /usr/vice/etc/CellServDB
      for non-Debian clients using the standard AFS paths), and the client
      will have to be restarted before it will know about the new db
      server.

  The standard rule of thumb is that all of your database servers and file
  servers should ideally be running the same version of OpenAFS.  However,
  in practice OpenAFS is fairly good at backward compatibility and you can
  generally mix and match different versions.  Be careful, though, to
  ensure that all of your database servers are built the same when it
  comes to options like --enable-supergroups (enabled in the Debian
  packages).

Upgrades

  Currently, during an upgrade of the openafs-fileserver package, all
  services will be stopped and restarted.  If openafs-dbserver is upgraded
  without upgrading openafs-fileserver, those server binaries will not be
  stopped and restarted; that restart will have to be done by hand.

  It is possible that future versions of this package will install for
  example /usr/lib/openafs/fileserver.package instead of
  /usr/lib/openafs/fileserver and then create links to the actual binaries
  in postinst.  Upgrades would then not replace the old binaries, but
  instead a script will be provided to roll the links forward to the new
  versions.  The intent is that people could install the new package on
  all their servers and then quickly move the links before restarting the
  bosserver.  This has not yet been implemented.
