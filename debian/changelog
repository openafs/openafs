  * New upstream release candidate.
    - Builds with 2.6.18 on AMD64.  (Closes: #389729)
  * Build an openafs-dbg package with debugging information for the
    OpenAFS fileserver and volserver.
  * Add LSB comments to the openafs-client and openafs-fileserver init
    scripts.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V5.

openafs (1.4.2~fc2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate.
    - Supports new Linux kernel versions.  (Closes: #383028)
  * Translation updates:
    - German, thanks Henrik Kroeger.  (Closes: #384803)

openafs (1.4.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream fix from Derek Atkins for compilation with kernel
    versions prior to 2.6.10.  (Closes: #376576)

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Jul 2006 12:35:44 -0700

openafs (1.4.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include all of AFS's local XDR implementation in the build for
    shlibafsrpc, fixing problems with undefined symbols in the PAM module
    on AMD64.
  * When creating a new file server in afs-newcell, use a set of tuning
    flags from Harald Barth rather than relying on the defaults.  This
    doesn't help with general bos create; long term, the defaults need to
    be fixed.  (Closes: #364100)
  * Add a note in README.servers about fileserver tuning options.
  * Update debconf templates to follow the best practice recommendations
    from the Developer's Reference.
  * Regenerate the man pages on build since the pre-generated ones were
    done with a very old version of pod2man.
  * Update standards version to 3.7.2 (no changes required).
  * Use a better method of optionally running make distclean.
  * Add build-arch and build-indep targets, just in case.
  * Translation updates:
    - Czech, thanks Martin Šín.
    - Portuguese (Brazil), thanks André Luís Lopes.
    - French, thanks Christian Perrier.
    - Vietnamese, thanks Clytie Siddall.

openafs (1.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Exit successfully in the openafs-client init script if no module is
    installed, since otherwise openafs-client will fail to install until
    one builds a module.  This restores previous accidental behavior due
    to a bug in debhelper.  (Closes: #362695)
  * libopenafs-dev must conflict with liblwp-dev since they both provide
    liblwp.a.  Thanks, Justin Pryzby.  (Closes: #362842)
  * openafs-client recommends lsof, since the init script uses it for
    cleaner shutdown.

openafs (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Supports Linux 2.6.16.  (Closes: #358203)
    - Suspend should work with newer kernels.  (Closes: #341588)
    - Safer cache size calculation.  (Closes: #360176)
    - Upstream now includes man pages, so remove our backport.
  * Subsume openafs-krb5 into this source package.
    - Acknowledge NMU.  (Closes: #304933)
    - Update to the OpenAFS aklog and asetkey.  (Closes: #196094)
    - Backport asetkey from upstream CVS.
    - Include ka-forwarder from the old migration toolkit.
    - Add man pages for asetkey and ka-forwarder.
  * Subsume openafs-doc into this source package.
  * Since 2.6 is the supported kernel for etch, build the userspace with
    a sysname of *_linux26 where supported.  This only affects the sys
    command.  (Using livesys instead is better.)  (Closes: #358118)
  * Always pass the system type into Autoconf, following autotools-dev
    best practices.
  * Add an explicit copyright statement to debian/copyright.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Apr 2006 15:04:45 -0700

openafs (1.4.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Hopefully fix sparc64 kernel support.  Thanks, Troy Benjegerdes.
    (Closes: #219429)
  * Document the need to restart ptserver and vlserver on the existing
    database servers when adding a new one.  Thanks, Niklas Edmundsson.
    (Closes: #349659)
  * Include xstat_cm_test and xstat_fs_test in openafs-client, as they're
    quite useful for debugging.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 14 Mar 2006 21:07:07 -0800

openafs (1.4.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch from Chas Williams to be more careful about what
    dentry is used in renames, avoiding a kernel fault when renaming
    dentries accessed through multiple paths (such as RO and RW).
  * Apply patch to allow the module to build with the Ubuntu kernel.
    Thanks, Björn Torkelsson.  (Closes: #342607)
  * Stop unconditionally forcing the compiler to cc or gcc in configure,
    allowing, among other things, building the kernel module with a
    compiler other than the default system compiler.  (Closes: #338306)
  * Call kernel-version correctly from prep-modules, which fixes build
    issues with manually-built kernels.  (Closes: #344851)
  * Backport man pages from upstream CVS.  (Closes: #79763)
  * Include afsmonitor and livesys in openafs-client.
  * Include volinfo in openafs-fileserver.
  * Document FAM's lack of support for AFS's security model and recommend
    gamin instead.  (Closes: #343246)
  * Add a hint to README.Debian on what to do about the cache partition if
    running ReiserFS or XFS without a spare partition.
  * Use make install into debian/tmp rather than make dest.  make dest is
    mostly for Transarc compatibility and make install looks more like a
    typical package and makes it easier to evaluate differences in FHS
    location between upstream and Debian.  As a side effect, there's no
    need to mess with the @sys link.  (Closes: #165909)
  * Install more files with dh_install rather than install commands in
    debian/rules so that *.install shows a more complete picture of what
    goes into each package.
  * Don't ignore make distclean errors.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Dec 2005 15:34:16 -0800

openafs (1.4.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install more of the standard OpenAFS utilities.  (Closes: #138851)
    - openafs-dbserver: Install prdb_check and vldb_check.
    - openafs-fileserver: Install voldump.
    - openafs-client: Install fstrace, scout, and up (as afs-up).
    - Modify fstrace to load its catalog from /usr/share/openafs.
  * Do not install kpwvalid.  The default version does little useful and
    the kpwvalid binary must be in AFS for it to take effect.
  * Overhaul the way kernel modules are built.
    - Recommend linux-image rather than kernel-image for newer kernels.
    - Always recommend the kernel package; since it's only a recommends,
      there's no need to special-case the hand-built kernel case.
    - Be less fragile about how the kernel version is used in prep-modules
      to support other ways kernel modules are built.  (Closes: #341836)
    - Add Build-Depends and Uploaders to the openafs-modules-source
      control file.
    - Remove unused parts of prep-modules and heavily comment it.
  * openafs-client should only recommend the AFS kernel module.  Many of
    the client programs will work in unauthenticated mode without it, and
    openafs-fileserver depends on it (but doesn't require the kernel
    module).  (Closes: #342095)
  * openafs-modules-source no longer has to depend on as many libraries.
  * Suggest the same PAM settings for pam_krb5 that libpam-krb5 does.
  * Update uploader address.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Dec 2005 23:34:18 -0800

openafs (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - Builds correctly with 2.6.13 kernels and software suspend.
    - Builds correctly with 2.6.12-10.  (Closes: #337883)
  * Install afsd in /sbin rather than /usr/sbin.  While putting /usr in
    AFS isn't as common as it once was, no reason to make it harder than
    it needs to be.
  * Update CellServDB to the 2005-10-15 grand.central.org version.
  * Install NEWS as an upstream changelog.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Remove the unused and uninstalled make-links script.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Sun,  6 Nov 2005 21:37:40 -0800

openafs (1.4rc4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - Correctly handle root.afs becoming replicated after the client
      starts.  This should resolve the problems with AFS eventually
      failing on the first system using a new cell.  (Closes: #88906)
  * When kill_all_afs is enabled in /etc/openafs/afs.conf, only kill AFS
    processes if the runlevel is 0 or 6.  You really only want this when
    the system is shutting down.  (Closes: #325347)
  * Remove the init script check of the cache file system and instead
    improve the check in afsd.  The init script check used stat, which is
    in /usr/bin and therefore not fair game for init scripts.
  * Set PATH in the init script, just in case.
  * libpam-openafs-kaserver must depend on openafs-client, not just
    recommend it, since acquiring tokens requires that the client be
    running.
  * Expand README.Debian and include information about PAM configuration.
  * Link libpam-openafs-kaserver's doc directory to openafs-client.
  * Make the short descriptions shorter.
  * Translation updates.
    - Portuguese (Brazil), thanks André Luís Lopes.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Wed, 21 Sep 2005 13:36:34 -0700

openafs (1.4rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Install pam_afs.krb.so on hppa.  I believe the new PAM module build
    process fixes the issue that was being worked around before.
  * Improve the documentation and scripts for setting up new servers or a
    new cell.  afs-rootvol can now be run from a client configured to use
    dynroot.  afs-newcell generates the server CellServDB directly to work
    around oddities with bos addhost.  There are many other, more minor
    improvements as well.  Thanks to Faheem Mitha and Sergio Gelato for
    analysis and patches.  (Closes: #322638)
  * Update the configuration transcript to reflect the current packages,
    messages, and instructions.  Thanks, Faheem Mitha.
  * Fill in the server CellServDB with information about the local cell,
    if available in the client CellServDB, rather than always initializing
    it to contain just the name of the cell.
  * Detect AFS caches on non-ext2/ext3 file systems and abort AFS client
    initialization.  (Closes: #249315)
  * Provide a way of setting sysname in afs.conf.  (Closes: #324694)
  * Don't create the unused /etc/openafs/AFSLog file.  (Closes: #120097)
  * Redo how library object files are found for the PAM module build to
    avoid assuming C locale character set behavior.  (Closes: #323582)
  * Remove the openafs-client warning against dynroot for the first system
    in a cell now that afs-rootvol can cope.  Provide some basic
    documentation of the CellAlias syntax in that message until we have a
    real man page.
  * Suggest openafs-doc.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 for the kernel module packages (no
    changes required).
  * Translation updates.
    - Czech, thanks Martin Sin.
    - Vietnamese, thanks Clytie Siddall.
    - French, thanks Christian Perrier.

openafs (1.3.87-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
    - Fixes build problems with 2.6.12.3 and later.  (Closes: #320099)
  * Add support for ppc64, thanks Andreas Jochens.  (Closes: #322020)
  * Improve the openafs-client init script.
    - Update the default client options based on the cache tuning synopsis
      by Jeffrey Hutzelman, including setting a larger chunksize for all
      default option sets.  (Closes: #303944)
    - Choose the client options based on the cache size by default.
    - Move the code to build the options string to the init script from
      afs.conf so that afs.conf is pure configuration.
    - Add an AFS_PRE_SHUTDOWN hook called before shutting down the client.
    - Provide a shutdown hook, disabled by default, that kills all
      processes with files open in /afs.  Enabling this ensures a more
      reliable clean shutdown and umounting of the cache partition, but
      may not always be what the admin wants.
    - Improve the readability of the output on start.
    - Significantly improve the comments in afs.conf.
    - Remove the code to set -nosettime as it's now the default.
  * Move the openafs-client init script and afs.conf file we use into the
    debian directory rather than patching the upstream version.  We've
    diverged so much that there's no point in continuing to merge changes.
  * Diagnose unsupported architectures earlier and with a clearer error.
  * Suppress error messages from a missing kernel version header since
    they occur normally when doing the regular package build and are just
    confusing.  Instead, print an error in kern-sysname and abort if the
    kernel version could not be determined.
  * Rework how PAM modules are handled.
    - Build against the pthread-aware libraries.  (Closes: #297804)
    - Use the shared library objects instead of building separate PIC
      objects, eliminating the need for many Makefile modifications.
    - Include pam_afs.krb.so as well.  (Closes: #165972)
  * Don't include the empty /usr/src/modules directory in
    openafs-modules-source, only the tarball, to match how other kernel
    module source packages behave.  (Closes: #244685)
  * Update config.guess and config.sub.
  * Translation updates.
    - French, thanks Christian Perrier.  (Closes: #318807)
    - Vietnamese, thanks Clytie Siddall.  (Closes: #319705)

openafs (1.3.82-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Output error messages from heredocs in the init script with cat rather
    than echo.  Thanks, Reid Barton.  (Closes: #311729)
  * Make bosserver less picky about permissions and remove the attempt to
    set /etc/openafs/server-local not-world-readable since dh_fixperms was
    overridding it anyway.  (Closes: #312921)
  * Fix some spacing and capitalization errors in the debconf templates.
    Thanks, Clytie Siddall.  (Closes: #316597)
  * Initial Czech translation, thanks Martin Sin.  (Closes: #310699)
  * New Vietnamese translation, thanks Clytie Siddall.  (Closes: #316598)
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).

openafs (1.3.82-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version.  (Closes: #307699)
    - Proper locking for preempt kernels.  This bug manifested as an
      inability to shut down AFS cleanly.  (Closes: #308399, #304040)
    - Correctly handle the inotify semaphore.  (Closes: #303495)
  * Repackage upstream to remove MacOS-specific files covered by the APSL.
    Remove the WINNT directory to save space since we have to repackage
    anyway.  Provide a get-orig-source target to do the repackaging.
  * libpam-openafs-kaserver: Fix compilation so that the PAM module isn't
    missing symbols and therefore unusable.  (Closes: #308844)
  * Apply patch from Chas Williams to fix stale cache data from deleted
    files, a bug introduced in 1.3.82.
  * In all cases, only build the module appropriate to the kernel we're
    building against.  Building an SMP module against a non-SMP kernel
    fails due to missing defines.  (Closes: #225907)
  * README.modules: Add documentation for module-assistant and recommend
    it when using Debian kernels.  Mention divergences from upstream in
    module naming.  (Closes: #253168)  Emphasize that the kernel source
    tree used for make-kpkg must be identically configured to the kernel
    the module will be used with.
  * Update copyright with more complete information from upstream
    src/LICENSE.
  * Simplify clean target.  Upstream make distclean is now better.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Tue, 10 May 2005 21:09:55 -0700

openafs (1.3.81-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle modules named either with or without the .mp extension on SMP
    hosts.  (Closes: #305389, #307280, #307797)
  * README.Debian: Document that the client cache partition must be ext2
    or ext3 and that XFS and ReiserFS will not work.  upserver and
    upclient are now provided.  Provide some information about why
    kaserver is not provided.  (Closes: #249315)
  * Overhaul the module build rules.
    - Use debhelper to build the module binary package.
    - Let debhelper handle the module postinst and prerm control scripts.
    - Properly support modules_config and modules_clean.
    - Break the build process into configure, build, install, and binary
      rules, paralleling the regular build rules and making it easier to
      maintain the make-kpkg build targets.
    - Include the kernel version in the long description.
    - Update standards version of module packages to 3.6.1.
    - Include the copyright and basic documentation in the module binary
      package.  Otherwise, policy requires an exact versioned dependency
      on the package containing the copyright file.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.1.
    - Install Debian::OpenAFS::ConfigUtils in /usr/share, not /usr/lib.
    - Always enable debugging symbols and disable optimization if noopt is
      set in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  (Alas, this doesn't entirely work; the
      upstream makefiles don't always honor the configure options.)
    - /etc/init.d/openafs-fileserver restart starts bosserver if it's not
      already running.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V4.
    - Remove all *.conffiles control files.  They're no longer needed.
    - Use misc:Depends to get debconf dependencies.
    - Use dh_install rather than the movefiles script.
  * openafs-dbserver doesn't need to depend on debconf.
  * Use dh_perl to get the correct Perl dependency for openafs-dbserver.
  * Remove unnecessary build dependencies.
  * Depend on comerr-dev rather than e2fslibs-dev.
  * Remove unnecessary preinst for openafs-fileserver.
  * Clean up and reformat package build rules.
  * Update lintian overrides.

  * New script: afs-rootvol--creates the root.afs and root.cell.  Works
    fairly well except that it is overly verbose and that it has my test
    cell hardcoded.  This script will evolve into part of a new cell
    config tool. 


  --
  * Support removing module for smP
  * Prune build directories out of modules sources--oops
  * Fix bogus depends for module sources--note that it really does want
    bison and flex at least for now.
