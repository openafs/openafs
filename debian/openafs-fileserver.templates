Type: boolean
default: true
Description: Upgrading will move files to new locations; continue? 
 Between Openafs 1.1 and Openafs 1.2, several files moved.  In
 particular,  files in /etc/openafs/server-local have been distributed
 to other locations.  The BosConfig file is now located in
 /etc/openafs and the other files are located in /var/lib/openafs.  If
 you continue with this upgrade, these files will be moved. You should
 use the bos restart command to  reload your servers.  Any
 configuration changes made before you do so will be lost.
