=head1 NAME

VolserLog - Traces Volume Server operations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The F<VolserLog> file records a trace of Volume Server (B<volserver>
process) operations on the local machine and describes any error
conditions it encounters.

If the VolserLog file does not already exist in the F</usr/afs/logs>
directory when the Volume Server starts, the server process creates it and
writes initial start-up messages to it. If there is an existing file, the
Volume Server renames it to F<VolserLog.old>, overwriting the existing
F<VolserLog.old> file if it exists.

The file is in ASCII format. Administrators listed in the
F</usr/afs/etc/UserList> file can use the B<bos getlog> command to display
its contents. Alternatively, log onto the file server machine and use a
text editor or a file display command such as the UNIX B<cat> command. By
default, the mode bits on the F<VolserLog> file grant the required C<r>
(read) permission to all users.

The Volume Server records operations only as it completes them, and so
cannot recover from failures by reviewing the file. The log contents are
useful for administrative evaluation of process failures and other
problems.
