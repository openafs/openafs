OpenAFS News -- history of user-visible changes.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.4.0

** Addition of pthreading support in volserver.

** Threading optimization of RX libraries.

** Windows 95/98 client desupported.

** Digital UNIX/Tru64 desupported.

** Windows XP/2003 client includes persistent (across boots) cache support.

** Windows XP/2003 now supports a cache of up to 1.2gb.

** Windows XP/2003 has various improvements to the included GUI and command 
   line tools.

** Windows XP/2003 now supports AFS UNC paths.

** MacOS X (10.3) and Linux use system inodes instead of a private inode pool.

** Files larger than 2gb are supported in Unix clients, and in servers if the 
   --enable-largefile-fileserver switch is enabled at configure time.

** Obsolete and insecure auxiliary network daemons (rcp, rsh, ftpd et al)
   have been removed.

** Fileserver optimizations have been made to improve timeout and callback 
   breaking behavior to inaccessible clients or clients whose address has
   changed.

** Kerberos 5 support is integrated.

** -nosettime is now the default for afsd.  Use "-settime" to get the
   old behavior.

** Mountpoint directory information is now only faked for cross-cell
   mountpoints when using the -fakestat flag (e.g. for the directories
   under /afs, but not for most other volumes mounted inside the cell).
   The -fakestat-all switch can be used to fake information for all
   mountpoints.

** When fakestat is enabled on MacOSX, the Finder can be used to browse
   a fully-populated /afs directory.  However, this precludes reliable
   use of entire volumes as MacOS bundles (i.e. containing a Contents
   directory in the root of the volume).

** Mountpoint directory information can be faked by the cache manager,
   making operations such as stat'ing all cells under /afs much faster.
   This is enabled by passing -fakestat to afsd, but might not be stable
   on all platforms.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.9

** The kaserver now defaults to not allowing interrealm authentication,
   due to security vulnerabilities in the krb4 protocol.  The new
   "-crossrealm" flag to the kaserver is provided to reenable interrealm
   authentication if desired.

** RedHat Linux 9.0 is now supported.

** Solaris 9 12/02 is now supported.  Solaris 7 and 8 x86 should now
   work again.

** On Linux machines using 2.2 series kernels, 2.2.19 or higher is now
   required.

** An OpenAFS 1.2.9 afsd will not work with kernel modules built from
   an earlier OpenAFS release.  In general, using a mismatched afsd and
   kernel modules set is unsupported; it is not recommended that you use
   such a configuration on a regular basis.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.8

** Mountpoint directory information is now only faked for cross-cell
   mountpoits when using the -fakestat flag (e.g. for the directories
   under /afs, but not for most other volumes mounted inside the cell).
   The -fakestat-all switch can be used to fake information for all
   mountpoints.

** HPUX 11.0 is now supported.

** It is now possible for AFS to use Kerberos 5 directly, via rxkad 2b.
   See the OpenAFS 1.2.8 Release Notes for more information on using this
   capability.

** An NFS translator kernel module is now included and compiled by default
   for Solaris only.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.7

** MacOS X 10.2 is now supported.  FreeBSD 4.3 and later support is included
   in this release, but is still under active development and should only
   be used by those doing active development on the OpenAFS FreeBSD client.

** When fakestat is enabled on MacOSX, the Finder can be used to browse
   a fully-populated /afs directory.  However, this precludes reliable
   use of entire volumes as MacOS bundles (i.e. containing a Contents
   directory in the root of the volume).

** The fileserver will now use Rx pings to determine if clients are reachable
   prior to allocating resources to them, to prevent asymmetric clients from
   consuming all fileserver resources.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.6

** Mountpoint directory information can be faked by the cache manager,
   making operations such as stat'ing all cells under /afs much faster.
   This is enabled by passing -fakestat to afsd.

** Solaris 9 FCS and Solaris 7 and 8 x86 are now supported.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.5

** A remote denial of service attack in the AIX and IRIX clients has
   been fixed.  Users of those platforms are strongly encouraged to
   upgrade.

** Fixed race conditions in fileserver that could result in crash.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.4

** Server logfiles now more consistant about format in which hosts are
   referred to.

** vfsck on Solaris will now allow force runs (using -y flag) even if old 
   inodes exist.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.3

** Cell aliases for dynroot can be specified in the CellAlias file in
   /usr/vice/etc or /usr/local/etc/openafs, in format "realname alias",
   one per line.  They can also be managed at runtime with "fs newalias"
   and "fs listaliases".

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.2

** Solaris 9 and Linux PA-RISC are now supported

** fileserver will not erroneously delay legitimate errors for 3 seconds
   after 10 errors are returned (e.g. stat() on a directory you can't read)

** Rx MTU calculation now works for Irix, Solaris and Linux

** If afsd is started with the -dynroot flag, /afs will be locally
   generated from the CellServDB.  AFSDB cells will be mounted
   automatically upon access.

** The namei fileserver allows vice "partitions" to be directories instead
   of partitions and will attach and display accordingly. Creating the file
   "AlwaysAttach" in the /vicepX directory is used as the trigger to attach it.

** TSM support for butc no longer requires editing a Makefile, simply
   specify the --enable-tivoli-tsm configure option.

** Linux builds no longer require source changes every time the kernel
   inode structure changes; the OpenAFS sources will now configure
   itself to the actual inode structure as defined in the kernel
   sources.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.1

** vfsck on Digital UNIX and Solaris will now refuse to fsck mounted
   mounted partitions.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.2.0

** AFS now supports --prefix and the other directory options of
   configure.  By default AFS builds assuming it will be installed in
   /usr/local.  In order to get traditional AFS directory paths (/usr/afs
   and /usr/vice/etc) use the --enable-transarc-paths option to
   configure.  More details on the new directory layout are found in README.

* Changes incorporated in OpenAFS 1.1.1a
 
** Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000 - Consistent versioning
   Installation, AFS Control Center, Client dialog boxes and properties 
   pages for executables display a consistent OpenAFS version number. 
   Installation detects previous installation and prompts the user for upgrade 
   options.

** Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000 - Installation features
   During installation the user can select the source of the CellservDB file,
   AFS home cell, and drive mappings.  During installation a drive path 
   mapping can include a variable that will be substituted with the current 
   UserName that is logged in.

** Windows 2000/NT - Integrated logon
   The Integrated Logon feature works now.

** Windows 95/98/ME - Logon script features
   The Windows 95/98/ME client now offers a command-line option for starting up 
   the AFS client without authenication. It is now possilbe to start the AFS 
   client first and obtain tokens, and map drives all through Windows scripts.
   This helps using Windows 95/98/ME client in Kerberos 5 environment.

** Windows 2000/NT - LANA numbers
   AFS client now scans the LANA numbers to establish the correct NETBIOS
   connection.  NetBEUI is no longer needed.  The user no longer needs to find
   the correct LANA number.

** Windows 2000/NT - OpenAFS naming consistancy
   Further progress has been made to remove references to "Transarc AFS"
   and replace with "OpenAFS".


  
* Changes since OpenAFS 1.0 

** AFS now builds with configure. The README for building has been
   updated and includes full details.

** A client system can now have multiple sysname values for @sys.
   They will be searched in order when looking up files in AFS.  The
   -newsysname argument to fs sysname can be repeated to set multiple
   sysnames.

** A new system group is created for new cells (system:ptsviewers
   with id -203).  If this group exists, members of this group can
   examine and read the entire protection database.  They can examine
   all users and groups and can get the membership of any group.

** A new program, pt_util has been added to the distribution.  This
   program allows users to print the contents of the protection
   database or to edit the protection database without running a
   ptserver.  It can be used to set up a new cell without ever running
   in noauth mode.  Run pt_util -h for help.

** The fs setcrypt and fs getcrypt commands have been added.  These
   commands allow the system administrator to require that the client
   encrypt all authenticated traffic between the client workstation
   and AFS.  The encryption used is weak, but is likely better than
   sending unencrypted traffic in most environments.  Some functions,
   such as looking for a volume may not be encrypted, but data
   transfer certainly is.  By default data is not encrypted.  At this
   time no significant experimentation with server performance has
   been conducted.

** By default AFS is compiled with AFS_AFSDB_ENV, enabling the -afsdb 
   option to be given to afsd on startup.  If this option is used, then new
   cells will be looked up using AFSDB records stored in DNS if they
   are not found in CellServDB.  This means that users can create
   cross-cell mountpoints in directories they control to access cells
   not in root.afs, and that cells in root.afs need not be in the
   client's CellServDB.

** AFS database servers can be marked as read-only clones.  Surround
   the hostname in square brackets on the bos addhost command and the
   database server will never be elected sync site.  This is useful
   for cells distributed over a wide region.

** The AFS servers now support the -syslog flag.  This flag causes
   them to log to syslog rather than to files.  This flag is not
   supported on NT.  For all servers besides the salvager, the flag can
   also be specified as -syslog=facility, where facility is an integer
   facility code from syslog.h.  A -syslogfacility option is provided for
   the salvager to accomplish the same goal.

** If the --enable-fast-restart flag is given when configuring AFS,
   then the salvager supports the -dontsalvage flag which causes it to 
   exit without salvaging any volumes.  If this is configured into the 
   third command of a fs process, then the fileserver will start without 
   salvaging.  It will fail to attach volumes that need salvaging and they
   can be salvaged manually.  This provides significantly better server 
   startup performance at the cost of administrative complexity.

** If the --enable-bitmap-later flag is given when configuring AFS,
   then the fileserver creates bitmaps for free vnodes on demand, allowing 
   faster starts.

** If bosserver finds a BosConfig.new file at startup, it reads this
   file and renames it to BosConfig.  This allows bosserver to be
   reconfigured at next restart.

** The bosserver can be placed in a restricted mode in
   which AFS superusers are only granted limited access to the server
   host. The following functionality is disabled when restricted mode is in
   use:

    bos exec
    bos getlog (except for files with no '/'s in their name)*
    bos create *
    bos delete
    bos install
    bos uninstall

   specific exceptions are made for functionality that "bos salvage"
   uses:

    a cron bnode who's name is "salvage-tmp", time is now, and command
    begins with "/usr/afs/bin/salvager" may be created. This bnode 
    deletes itself when complete, so no special "delete" support is needed. 
    This functionality may be removed in the future if a "Salvage" RPC is 
    implimented.

    The file with the exact path /usr/afs/logs/SalvageLog may be fetched,
    since that is how bos salvage [...] -showlog is implimented.

    Restricted mode is enabled using a new bos command (bos setrestricted)
    or bossever command line switch (bosserver -restricted). Restricted
    mode can be disabled by a) sending the bosserver process a SIGFPE (which
    will then allow restricted operations until the next restart or
    setrestricted command) or b) editing /usr/afs/local/BosConfig 
    (or BosConfig.new), and restarting the bosserver.

** The bos UserList of trusted administrators can now contain
   cross-realm Kerberos principals.

** udebug now takes --server not --servers.

** Several error messages have been improved to include volume
   numbers.

** Several new ports have been included for UNIX platforms: Darwin
   (ppc_darwin_12 and ppc_darwin_13), Linux 2.4 (i386_linux24), Linux on
   the Powerpc (ppc_linux22 and ppc_linux24), Linux on the Sparc
   (sparc_linux22, sparc64_linux22 and sparc64_linux24) .

** Incomplete FreeBSD and Alpha Linux ports are included.  The
   FreeBSD port has a working server and the Alpha Linux port has a
   partially working client.

** A native client for Windows 95/98/ME has been added to the distribution.
   With this program, a gateway machine is no longer required for Windows 9x
   to access AFS files.  One drive letter will be created on your machine by
   default - Z:.  The Z: drive will be the root of the AFS tree, allowing you
   to browse all sites that have AFS servers available.  Additional drive
   letters can be defined for other AFS directories.  A Windows Explorer
   shell extension is included that allows you to right click on items
   within an AFS tree to bring up an "AFS" menu item and perform various
   operations on a file or directory.  The most useful item is "Access
   Control Lists", which allows you to view and edit the permissions of a
   particular directory.  Command line tools are also available in the
   install directory.  These commands include klog, unlog, tokens, kpasswd,
   symlink, fs and pts.  The installable includes a readme file that contains
   more information on how to use the client program and known issues.

** support for large caches in afsd.  Cachefiles are stored in
   subdirectories.  The default is 2048 files per subdirectory, which
   should work fine in most situations.  You can use the new afsd
   option -files_per_subdir to change this number.  Note that the first
   time you run afsd with this patch, your cachefiles will get moved
   into subdirectories.  If you subsequently run an older version of
   afsd, you will lose all your cached files.
