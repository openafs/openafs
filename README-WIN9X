NOTE: As of the OpenAFS 1.3 release series, Windows 9x platforms are no
longer officially supported.  It is not clear whether or not the source
tree will build successfully or not.  As far as we know, no one has tried
in a very long time.

Building Open AFS on Win 95
---------------------------

The Windows 95 Open AFS client consists of two main components: the client
program afsd.exe, which is compiled with the DJGPP compiler and runs in a
DOS virtual machine; and the utility programs, which are built on Windows
NT or 9x using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler V6.0.

afsd.exe
--------

afsd.exe is built using the DJGPP cross-compiler, executed from Linux.
It should also be possible to build it using the native DOS DJGPP compiler,
but we did not try this.  You will need to install the following packages
from DJGPP and the Coda project.

ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/tools/djgpp-2.01_0.93_glibc-1.i386.rpm
ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/tools/djgpp-win95ext-2.01_0.93_glibc-1.i386.rpm
ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/tools/gdb-djgpp-4.16-2.i386.rpm

You will also need the MMAP.VXD and SOCK.VXD from the Coda project.  Source
is available here:
ftp://ftp.coda.cs.cmu.edu/pub/coda/src/win95-coda-5.2.0.zip

Follow the Coda instructions to build these VXD's, which you can read here:
http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/doc/html/coda-howto-6.html#ss6.4

Once you have the necessary tools installed, set the following environment
variables:
SYS_NAME: set to i386_djgpp
LINUX_SYS: set to the sysname of the Linux version you are using, e.g.,
           i386_linux22

The makefile expects to build into a platform directory with symlinks
into the source directory.  The Perl script "mkdest.pl" in this dir. will
set this up for you.  To use it, create a directory under the top-level
dir. (the directory above src) called "i386_djgpp".  Then cd to that
directory and type "../src/mkdest.pl <absolute path of your src dir.>"

Then execute "make -f Makefile.djgpp" from the top-level directory.
(You can create a symlink to src/Makefile.djgpp from this dir.)
The afsd.exe will be built into i386_djgpp/dest/bin.

Build notes:

  The Makefile.djgpp actually builds Linux versions of the utilities
  rxgen, install, compile_et, and util.a.  It uses the Linux version
  of param.h which it copies to the afs subdirectory of the above
  components.  You will need to set SYS_NAME to your Linux system name
  manually if you want to build these utilities separately.

Utilities and GUI programs
--------------------------

The rest of the support programs are built as Win32 executables from a
Windows 9x or NT system.  You will need to set the following environment
variables:

set SYS_NAME=i386_win95
set AFSDEV_BUILDTYPE=CHECKED (or FREE if you want to skip debugging info.)
set AFSDEV_INCLUDE=<path of your Visual C include files>
set AFSDEV_LIB=<path of your Visual C libs>
set AFSDEV_BIN=.
set AFSROOT=<PATH to base of development directory> 
	e.g. AFSROOT\SRC is source directory of the build tree
SET _WIN32_IE=0x400
set OBJ=src or obj, see below
set MSSDK=<path to sdk header files>, see below

If you are building on a Unix directory exported to Windows through Samba
or AFS, you can create a platform directory named "i386_win95" using the
"mkdest.pl" script as described above (run from a Unix system).  This will
only work on a file system that supports symbolic links.  If you are using
a platform directory, set the OBJ environment var. to "obj" and create
a symlink "obj" in the top-level dir. that points to "i386_win95/obj".
Otherwise, set OBJ to "src" to build the objects with the sources.

The environment variable AFSROOT points to the parent of the AFS src
directory.  Executables will be built by default in AFSROOT\dest.

Copy the file src\NTMake9x to the parent of the src directory.  You only
need to do this once.  If you are building on a local drive, copy
AFSROOT\src\symlink.bat to AFSROOT\.

Follow the NT build instructions in file "README-NT" to perform the build.
You will be using "NTMake9x" as the top-level makefile, instead of
"NTMakefile".  Most of the instructions in "README-NT" apply to the Win9x
build as well.

Build Notes:

1) If you are building the Windows 9x AFS Client Control Panel
   (win9xpanel), it requires shlwapi.h.  This file can be found in the
   header files associated with the Windows SDK (95/98 NT or W2000).

2) You can build the Windows 9x client from a Windows NT or W2000 system.
   This requires you to edit AFSROOT\config\NTMakefile.i386_win95.
   Change line: DEL = $(AFSROOT)\src\rmbat
		 to:  DEL = -del  /q /f

3) If you build the W2000 client, then switch to building the Windows 95
   client (or vice versa), you should clean the previous build by either:
	nmake -f ntmakefile clean 
or 	nmake -f ntmake9x clean

4) When building the "comerr" component, the makefile now uses the
   existing error_table_nt.c file (and touches it so it will be up to date
   by default.)  If you make changes to the lex or yacc source files and want
   to rebuild error_table_nt.c, you can simply delete it and rerun make,
   which will cause the file to be built using lex and yacc.  Make sure
   you have these utilities on your system.

5) Required DLL's for redistribution

   The AFS Control Panel for Win95/98 requires Microsoft DLL's that can
   be installed using:
      VC6RedistSetup_enu.exe
   This is located at:
      http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q259/4/03.ASP
	Two Microsoft DLL's must be included at DEST\WinInstall\Config\.
	   SHLWAPI.DLL
	   WININET.DLL  
	These DLL's will not be left on the target machine, there are only
	used for installation and removed after installation is complete.

6) Required changes to configuration file .\src\config\NTMakefile.i386_win95

AFSPRODUCT_VERSION  - Product version
CELLNAME_DEFAULT - The default AFS cell name
CELLSERVDB_INSTALL - The default name for the CellServDB included in the install script
CELLSERVDB_WEB  - The default web address to obtain CellServDB
		  
For Example:

 .\src\config\NTMakefile.i386_win95  
   AFSPRODUCT_VERSION=1.1.1a
   CELLNAME_DEFAULT=openafs.org
   CELLSERVDB_INSTALL=CellServDB.GrandCentral
   CELLSERVDB_WEB=http://grand.central.org/dl/cellservdb/CellServDB

Version level may be specified in different formats, for example the following
forms all have the same version level; however will be displayed differently:

AFSPRODUCT_VERSION=1.1.1a
AFSPRODUCT_VERSION=1.1.1 a
AFSPRODUCT_VERSION=1.1.1.1
AFSPRODUCT_VERSION=1.1.101

6) Installation

   First, execute "nmake /f ntmake9x media" to copy all the client
   executables and other files to DEST\WinInstall.

   You can then install the client onto a target Windows 9x machine by
   executing:
     install.bat <source> <drive> <install dir.> <home cell> <cache size in 1K blocks>
   For example,
     install.bat DEST\WinInstall\ c: \afscli almaden.ibm.com 40000

   If you do not wish to use the batch file, you can install the client
   manually by performing the following steps.

   1. On the target machine, copy all the files from DEST\WinInstall to the
      install location (usually c:\afscli).
   2. Add entries to the target's AUTOEXEC.BAT file as follows:
       set AFSCONF=c:\afscli (replace with your install dir.)
       path %path%;c:\afscli
   3. Copy the template.reg file to afscli.reg.  Replace any references
      to c: and afscli with your install location.  Double click on the
      afscli.reg file to add the registry entries to the target system.
   4. Create the following AFS configuration files in the install dir.:
      - ThisCell:
        containing the name of your home cell
      - cache.info:
        containing your cache configuration.  For example,
        to configure a cache of 40,000 1KB blocks with a disk cache
        location of c:\afscache, you would enter in this file:
            /afs:c:\afscache;40000
        (The cache location has no effect unless you have enabled
        the experimental disk cache support.)
      - CellServDB:
        the cell server database.  You can get the latest version from AFS:
        /afs/transarc.com/service/etc/CellServDB.export
   5. Reboot the target machine.
   6. You can now start the client by executing the program WinAfsLoad.exe
      from the install directory.
