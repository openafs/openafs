Short instructions for sites upgrading from a previous version of AFS:
% ./configure --enable-transarc-paths
% make
% make dest

will create a Transarc-style dest tree in ${SYS_NAME}/dest where
${SYS_NAME} is the AFS sysname of the system you built for.
This assumes if you're building for Linux that your kernel source is
in /usr/src/linux.

Otherwise, please read on.

Building OpenAFS on UNIX and LINUX
----------------------------------

A. Creating the proper directory structure.

   Uncompress the source into a directory of your choice. A directory
   in afs space is also valid. In the directory that you uncompressed the
   source in, you will only have an src/ directory.

   1. Pick a system to build for, and note its default AFS sys_name.
      A directory will be automatically created for binaries to be written 
      into with this name when you build.

      hp_ux110 (See notes below for information on getting missing header)
      hp_ux102 (Client port possible, but db servers and utilities work)

   2. Using configure in the top level directory, configure for your
      AFS system type, providing the necessary flags:
      % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=sun4x_58 --enable-transarc-paths

      For some systems you need also provide the path in which your kernel
      headers for your configured kernel can be found.  See the
      system-specific Notes sections below for details.

      Be prepared to provide the switches --enable-obsolete and
      --enable-insecure if you require the use of any bundled but obsolete
      or insecure software included with OpenAFS. See README.obsolete and
      README.insecure for more details.

  There are two modes for directory path handling: "Transarc mode" and "default mode":
  - In Transarc mode, we retain compatibility with Transarc/IBM AFS tools
    by putting client configuaration files in /usr/vice/etc, and server
    files in /usr/afs under the traditional directory layout.
  - In default mode, files are located in standardized locations, usually
    under $(prefix).
  - Client programs, libraries, and related files always go in standard
    directories under $(prefix).  This rule covers things that would go
    into $(bindir), $(includedir), $(libdir), $(mandir), and $(sbindir).
  - Other files get located in the following places:

    Directory     Transarc Mode              Default Mode
    ============  =========================  ==============================
    viceetcdir    /usr/vice/etc              $(sysconfdir)/openafs
    afssrvdir     /usr/afs/bin (servers)     $(libexecdir)/openafs
    afsconfdir    /usr/afs/etc               $(sysconfdir)/openafs/server
    afslocaldir   /usr/afs/local             $(localstatedir)/openafs
    afsdbdir      /usr/afs/db                $(localstatedir)/openafs/db
    afslogdir     /usr/afs/logs              $(localstatedir)/openafs/logs
    afsbosconfig  $(afslocaldir)/BosConfig   $(afsconfdir)/BosConfig
    afsbosserver  $(afsbindir)/bosserver     $(sbindir)/bosserver


B  Building

   1. Now, you can build OpenAFS. 

      % make

   2. Install your build using either "make install" to install 
      into the current system (you will need to be root, and files
      will be placed as appropriate for Transarc or standard paths),
      "make install DESTDIR=/some/path" to install into an alternate 
      directory tree, or if you configured with --enable-transarc-paths
      make dest to create a complete binary tree in the dest directory      
      under the directory named for the sys_name you built for,
      e.g. sun4x_57/dest or i386_linux22/dest 

   2. As appropriate you can clean up or, if you're using Linux, build for
      another kernel version.
      To clean up:
         % make clean

C  Problems

   If you have a problem building this source, you may want to visit
   http://www.openafs.org/ to see if any problems have been reported 
   or to find out how to get more help.

   Mailing lists have been set up to help; More details can be found
   on the openafs.org site.

D  Linux Notes

   For Linux systems you need also provide the path in which your
   kernel headers for your configured kernel can be found. This should
   be the path of the directory containing a child directory named
   "include". So if your version file was 
   /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h you would invoke:
   % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=i386_linux24 --with-linux-kernel-headers=/usr/src/linux

   Currently you can build for only one Linux kernel at a time,
   and the version is extracted from the kernel headers in the root
   you specify.

   To build for another Linux kernel version:
   the system type defined in step A1.
      % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=i386_linux24 --with-linux-kernel-headers=/usr/src/linux-2.2.19-i686
      % make 

   Your dest tree will now include an additional kernel module for your
   additional kernel headers. Be aware that if the kernel version string
   which UTS_RELEASE is defined to in include/linux/version.h matches the
   last kernel you built for, the previous kernel module will be
   overwritten.

E  HP-UX 11.0 Notes

   HP-UX 11.0 requires a header called vfs_vm.h which HP has provided on their
   web site: http://h21007.www2.hp.com/dspp/tech/tech_TechSoftwareDetailPage_IDX/1,1703,687,00.html
   To navigate down from the top level of the portal, one would do

        www.hp.com/dspp -> i want to... -> download software -> operating systems

   to get to the same page. 

F  OpenBSD Notes

   We recommend you build with the following options to configure:
     --enable-namei-fileserver
     --enable-largefile-fileserver
     --enable-supergroups
     --with-krb5

   You need kernel source installed to build OpenAFS.  Use the
   --with-bsd-kernel-headers= configure option if your kernel source is not
   in /usr/src/sys.

   There is a package builder in src/packaging/OpenBSD.  "sh buildpkg.sh"
   should make a package for the client.  Use pkg_add to install.  The
   package will install using transarc-paths, regardless of how you
   configured.  The package builder does not work on OpenBSD 3.5 and later
   due to the incompatible re-write of pkg_create.

   There is no server package, but I am told that "make install" will put
   server binaries in /usr/afs.

   Your kernel may panic when you try to shutdown after running the OpenAFS
   client.  To prevent this, change the "dangling vnode" panic in
   sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c to a printf and build a new kernel.

   You can't run arla and OpenAFS at the same time.

G  FreeBSD Notes

   The FreeBSD client is very new and untested.  Do not trust it for
   production work.

   We recommend you build with --enable-namei-fileserver and
   --enable-largefile-fileserver options.

   You need kernel source installed to build OpenAFS.  Use the
   --with-bsd-kernel-headers= configure option if your kernel source is not
   in /usr/src/sys.

   You also need access to your kernel build directory for the opt_global.h
   include file.  Use the --with-bsd-kernel-build= configure option if your
   kernel build is not GENERIC in the standard place.

   There is a package builder in src/packaging/OpenBSD.  "sh buildpkg.sh"
   should make a package for the client.  Use pkg_add to install.  The
   package will install using transarc-paths, regardless of how you
   configured.  The builder uses an old version of the /usr/vice/etc/rc file
   that probably won't work.  You might be able to replace it with something
   like "kldload libafs.ko; /usr/vice/etc/afsd".

   There is no server package, but I am told that "make install" will put
   server binaries in /usr/afs.
