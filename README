AFS is a distributed file system that enables users to share and
access all of the files stored in a network of computers as easily as
they access the files stored on their local machines. The file system is
called distributed for this exact reason: files can reside on many
different machines, but are available to users on every machine.

OpenAFS 1.0 was originally released by IBM under the terms of the
IBM Public License 1.0 (IPL10).  For details on IPL10 see the LICENSE
file in this directory.  The current OpenAFS distribution is licensed
under a combination of the IPL10 and many other licenses as granted by
the relevant copyright holders.  The LICENSE file in this directory
contains more details, thought it is not a comprehensive statement.

See INSTALL for information about building and installing OpenAFS
on various platforms.

See doc/process/01-contributor-guide.md for developer information and
