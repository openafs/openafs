Short instructions for sites upgrading from a previous version of AFS:
% ./configure --enable-transarc-paths
% make
% make dest

will create a Transarc-style dest tree in ${SYS_NAME}/dest where
${SYS_NAME} is the AFS sysname of the system you built for.
This assumes if you're building for Linux that your kernel source is
in /usr/src/linux.

Otherwise, please read on.

Building OpenAFS on UNIX and Linux
----------------------------------

A  Configuring

   Uncompress the source into a directory of your choice. A directory
   in afs space is also valid. In the directory that you uncompressed the
   source in, you will only have an src/ directory.

   1. Pick a system to build for, and note its default AFS sys_name.
      A directory will be automatically created for binaries to be written 
      into with this name when you build.

      x86_darwin_80, x86_darwin90

   2. Using configure in the top level directory, configure for your
      AFS system type, providing the necessary flags:
      % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=sun4x_58 --enable-transarc-paths

      If you do not have the "configure" script, or if you modify the
      source files, you can re-create it by running regen.sh.  You will
      need autoconf to do this.

      For some systems you need also provide the path in which your kernel
      headers for your configured kernel can be found.  See the
      system-specific Notes sections below for details.  If you want to
      build only the user-space programs and servers and not the kernel
      module, specify the --disable-kernel-module option on the
      ./configure command line.

      All binaries, except for the 'fileserver' and 'volserver'
      executables, are stripped of their symbol table information by
      default.  To enable a debugging build, specify the --enable-debug
      option on the ./configure command line.  This builds with debugging
      compiler options and disables stripping of binaries.

      You can also use different combinations of --enable-debug and
      --enable (or --disable)-strip-binaries for finer control.  One can,
      for example, compile binaries for debug and strip them anyway.
      Alternatively, one can compile without debug and force the binaries
      to not be stripped.  Note that these combinations are not
      necessarily useful.

      The two binaries noted above, 'fileserver' and 'volserver' will
      never be stripped, regardless of any options given to configure.

   There are two modes for directory path handling: "Transarc mode" and
   "default mode":

   - In Transarc mode, we retain compatibility with Transarc/IBM AFS tools
     by putting client configuaration files in /usr/vice/etc, and server
     files in /usr/afs under the traditional directory layout.
   - In default mode, files are located in standardized locations, usually
     under $(prefix).
   - Client programs, libraries, and related files always go in standard
     directories under $(prefix).  This rule covers things that would go
     into $(bindir), $(includedir), $(libdir), $(mandir), and $(sbindir).
   - Other files get located in the following places:

    Directory     Transarc Mode              Default Mode
    ============  =========================  ==============================
    viceetcdir    /usr/vice/etc              $(sysconfdir)/openafs
    afssrvdir     /usr/afs/bin (servers)     $(libexecdir)/openafs
    afsconfdir    /usr/afs/etc               $(sysconfdir)/openafs/server
    afslocaldir   /usr/afs/local             $(localstatedir)/openafs
    afsdbdir      /usr/afs/db                $(localstatedir)/openafs/db
    afslogdir     /usr/afs/logs              $(localstatedir)/openafs/logs
    afsbosconfig  $(afslocaldir)/BosConfig   $(afsconfdir)/BosConfig
    afsbosserver  $(afsbindir)/bosserver     $(sbindir)/bosserver

   The Demand Attach Fileserver (DAFS), is built by providing the
   --enable-demand-attach-fs argument to configure.  Note that the
   bosserver must be built with DAFS in order to be able to create the
   dafs instance, which will be used in place of the fs instance.  In
   addition, the fileserver, volserver, salvager, salvage, and
   salvageserver binaries must be built for DAFS.

   For additional options, see section H below.

B  Building

   1. Now, you can build OpenAFS. 

      % make

   2. Install your build using either "make install" to install 
      into the current system (you will need to be root, and files
      will be placed as appropriate for Transarc or standard paths),
      "make install DESTDIR=/some/path" to install into an alternate 
      directory tree, or if you configured with --enable-transarc-paths
      make dest to create a complete binary tree in the dest directory      
      under the directory named for the sys_name you built for,
      e.g. sun4x_57/dest or i386_linux22/dest 

   2. As appropriate you can clean up or, if you're using Linux, build for
      another kernel version.
      To clean up:
         % make clean

C  Problems

   If you have a problem building this source, you may want to visit
   http://www.openafs.org/ to see if any problems have been reported 
   or to find out how to get more help.

   Mailing lists have been set up to help; More details can be found
   on the openafs.org site.

D  Linux Notes

   For Linux systems you need also provide the path in which your
   kernel headers for your configured kernel can be found. This should
   be the path of the directory containing a child directory named
   "include". So if your version file was 
   /usr/src/linux/include/linux/version.h you would invoke:
   % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=i386_linux24 \
       --with-linux-kernel-headers=/usr/src/linux

   Currently you can build for only one Linux kernel at a time,
   and the version is extracted from the kernel headers in the root
   you specify.

   To build for another Linux kernel version:
   the system type defined in step A1.
      % ./configure --with-afs-sysname=i386_linux24 \
          --with-linux-kernel-headers=/usr/src/linux-2.2.19-i686
      % make 

   Your dest tree will now include an additional kernel module for your
   additional kernel headers. Be aware that if the kernel version string
   which UTS_RELEASE is defined to in include/linux/version.h matches the
   last kernel you built for, the previous kernel module will be
   overwritten.

E  HP-UX 11.0 Notes

   HP-UX 11.0 requires a header called vfs_vm.h which HP has provided on
   their web site.  Go to http://www.hp.com/dspp, choose Software
   downloads from the side menu, and select Software: HP operating systems
   and then Operating systems: HP-UX from the select boxes.  The last
   select box will have an option for downloading vfs_vm.h.

F  OpenBSD Notes

   If you need to run regen.sh to make the configure script, you should
   first install autoconf-2.59, then setenv AUTOCONF_VERSION 2.59.

   You need kernel source installed to build OpenAFS.  Use the
   --with-bsd-kernel-headers= configure option if your kernel source is
   not in /usr/src/sys.

   src/packaging/OpenBSD/buildpkg.sh will make a tar file for installing
   the client.  There is no server package, but I am told that "make
   install" will put server binaries in /usr/afs.

   Your kernel may panic when you try to shutdown after running the
   OpenAFS client.  To prevent this, change the "dangling vnode" panic in
   sys/kern/vfs_syscalls.c to a printf and build a new kernel.

   You can't run arla and OpenAFS at the same time.

G  FreeBSD Notes

   The FreeBSD client may now work; It is tested on 7.0 and on current
   as of the commit date.

   You need kernel source installed to build OpenAFS.  Use the
   --with-bsd-kernel-headers= configure option if your kernel source is
   not in /usr/src/sys.

   You also need access to your kernel build directory for the opt_global.h
   include file.  Use the --with-bsd-kernel-build= configure option if your
   kernel build is not GENERIC in the standard place. If 
   /usr/src/sys/${CPUARCH}/compile/GENERIC does not point to 
   /usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC you may need to resolve that and retry the 
   build.

   There is no server package, but I am told that "make install" will put
   server binaries in /usr/afs.

   You can't run arla and OpenAFS at the same time.

H  AIX notes

   Make sure that your default build environment is 32bit, ie.
   the OBJECT_MODE environment variable is either unset or set to "32".

   Verify this before doing configure and make. For example, assuming ksh/bash:
   export OBJECT_MODE=32

   To build aklog (in order to be able to get tokens from your Kerberos v5
   ticket), you will need Kerberos libraries.  On AIX 6.1, the IBM
   Kerberos v5 libraries are in the packages krb5.client.rte and
   krb5.toolkit.adt on the Expansion Pack.

I  Other configure options

   AFS has a ton of other optional features that must be enabled using
   configure options.  Here is a summary:

   --enable-bitmap-later
       Speeds the startup of the fileserver by deferring reading volume
       bitmaps until necessary.  Demand attach is a better solution to the
       same problem.

   --enable-bos-new-config
       A bosserver built with this option will look for BosConfig.new when
       it restarts and, if present, replace BosConfig with that file
       before reading its configuration.

   --enable-bos-restricted-mode
       Enables support for restricted mode in the bosserver.  This mode
       can be enabled or disabled via a command-line switch and a signal
       and can be enabled (but not disabled) remotely.  When enabled,
       bosserver will not permit any operations that change the local file
       system (install, uninstall, prune), run commands on the server
       (exec, create, delete), or view files (getlog).

   --enable-demand-attach-fs
       Enable Demand Attach file servers.  Demand Attach is an extensive
       re-engineering of the file server that avoids the long startup and
       shutdown delays of the traditional file server by enabling
       persistance of file server state to disk.  It is still very new,
       but is expected to become the default in a future version of
       OpenAFS.

   --enable-disconnected
       Enable disconnected support in the cache manager (EXPERIMENTAL).

   --enable-fast-restart
       When restarting the fileserver, don't salvage volumes.  Instead,
       assume all volumes are okay and only take them off-line if that
       assumption is incorrect.  Using this option safely requires
       scanning the fileserver log for error messages when volumes are
       taken off-line and salvaging them manually.  Not recommended; use
       demand attach instead.

   --enable-icmp-pmtu-discovery
       Enable path MTU discovery in the Rx libraries by decoding ICMP
       unreachable packets.

   --enable-namei-fileserver
       Forces the namei fileserver on platforms (like Solaris) where the
       inode fileserver is the default.

   --enable-pthreaded-ubik
       Enable the threaded version of Ubik and install the threaded
       versions of Ubik servers.  See README.PTHREADED_UBIK for more
       information.  (EXPERIMENTAL)

   --enable-reduced-depends
       Try to minimize the shared library dependencies encoded in the
       binaries.  This omits from the link line all the libraries included
       solely because the Kerberos libraries depend on them and instead
       links the programs only against libraries whose APIs are called
       directly.  This will only work with shared Kerberos libraries and
       will only work on platforms where shared libraries properly encode
       their own dependencies (such as Linux).  It is intended primarily
       for building packages for Linux distributions to avoid encoding
       unnecessary shared library dependencies that make shared library
       migrations more difficult.  If none of the above made any sense to
       you, don't bother with this flag.

   --enable-supergroups
       Enables support of nested groups in the ptserver.  WARNING: Once
       you make use of this option by nesting one group inside another,
       the resulting PTS database cannot be correctly and safely used by a
       ptserver built without this option.

   --enable-tivoli-tsm
       Build with the Tivoli TSM API libraries for butc support of the
       Tivoli backup system.

   --enable-unix-sockets
       Enable use of UNIX domain sockets for fssync.

   It's also possible to disable some standard features.  None of these
   options are recommended but may be useful in unusual circumstances:

   --disable-afsdb
       Disable AFSDB DNS record support in the cache manager, normally
       used to find cell VLDB servers.

   --disable-full-vos-listvol-switch
       Removes support for the -format option to vos listvol and also
       suppresses some additional fields that were added to vos examine
       output but may confuse older software.

   --disable-largefile-fileserver
       Disable large file (>2GB) support in the fileserver.

   --disable-pam
       Do not build the AFS PAM modules.  Normally building them is
       harmless, but the PAM modules that come with OpenAFS are deprecated
       and should not be used unless you're still using the OpenAFS
       kaserver (which is itself deprecated and should not be used).

   You may need to pass one or more of the following options to specify
   the paths and locations of files needed by the OpenAFS build process:

   --with-krb5[=DIR]
   --with-krb5-include=DIR
   --with-krb5-lib=DIR
       Normally, OpenAFS will automatically build with Kerberos support if
       Kerberos is found during the build.  If your Kerberos libraries are
       in an unusual location, however, you may need to pass one or more
       of these flags.  --with-krb5 forces building with Kerberos support
       if given and will cause configure to fail if Kerberos is not found.
       You may optionally specify the root path to your Kerberos
       installation as an argument to --with-krb5.

       If you have a krb5-config script, it's used to find the flags to
       build with Kerberos.  If you have no krb5-config script, you can
       specify the location to the include files with --with-krb5-include
       and the libraries with --with-krb5-lib.  You may need to do this if
       Autoconf can't figure out whether to use lib, lib32, or lib64 on
       your platform.

   There are also some environment variables that you can set to control
   aspects of the build.  They can be set either on the configure command
   line (preferred) or in the environment.

   KRB5_CONFIG
       To specify a particular krb5-config script to use, either set the
       KRB5_CONFIG environment variable or pass it to configure like:

           ./configure KRB5_CONFIG=/path/to/krb5-config

       To not use krb5-config and force library probing even if there is a
       krb5-config script on your path, set KRB5_CONFIG to a nonexistent
       path:

           ./configure KRB5_CONFIG=/nonexistent
