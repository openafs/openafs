/*! \file
 * General Ubik Goal:
 * The goal is to provide reliable operation among N servers, such that any
 * server can crash with the remaining servers continuing operation within a
 * short period of time.  While a \b short outage is acceptable, this time
 * should be order of 3 minutes or less.
 *
 * Theory of operation:
 *
 * Note: #SMALLTIME and #BIGTIME are essentially the same time value, separated
 * only by the clock skew, #MAXSKEW.  In general, if you are making guarantees
 * for someone else, promise them no more than #SMALLTIME seconds of whatever
 * invariant you provide.  If you are waiting to be sure some invariant is now
 * \b false, wait at least #BIGTIME seconds to be sure that #SMALLTIME seconds
 * has passed at the other site.
 *
 * Now, back to the design:
 * One site in the collection is a special site, designated the \b sync site.
 * The sync site sends periodic messages, which can be thought of as
 * keep-alive messages.  When a non-sync site hears from the sync site, it
 * knows that it is getting updates for the next #SMALLTIME seconds from that
 * sync site.
 *
 * If a server does not hear from the sync site in #SMALLTIME seconds, it
 * determines that it no longer is getting updates, and thus refuses to give
 * out potentially out-of-date data.  If a sync site can not muster a majority
 * of servers to agree that it is the sync site, then there is a possibility
 * that a network partition has occurred, allowing another server to claim to
 * be the sync site.  Thus, any time that the sync site has not heard from a
 * majority of the servers in the last #SMALLTIME seconds, it voluntarily
 * relinquishes its role as sync site.
 *
 * While attempting to nominate a new sync site, certain rules apply.  First,
 * a server can not reply "ok" (return 1 from ServBeacon) to two different
 * hosts in less than #BIGTIME seconds; this allows a server that has heard
 * affirmative replies from a majority of the servers to know that no other
 * server in the network has heard enough affirmative replies in the last
 * #BIGTIME seconds to become sync site, too.  The variables #ubik_lastYesTime
 * and #lastYesHost are used by all servers to keep track of which host they
 * have last replied affirmatively to, when queried by a potential new sync
 * site.
 *
 * Once a sync site has become a sync site, it periodically sends beacon
 * messages with a parameter of 1, indicating that it already has determined
 * it is supposed to be the sync site.  The servers treat such a message as a
 * guarantee that no other site will become sync site for the next #SMALLTIME
 * seconds.  In the interim, these servers can answer a query concerning which
 * site is the sync site without any communication with any server.  The
 * variables #lastBeaconArrival and #lastBeaconHost are used by all servers to
 * keep track of which sync site has last contacted them.
 *
 * One complication occurs while nominating a new sync site: each site may be
 * trying to nominate a different site (based on the value of #lastYesHost),
 * yet we must nominate the smallest host (under some order), to prevent this
 * process from looping.  The process could loop by having each server give
 * one vote to another server, but with no server getting a majority of the
 * votes.  To avoid this, we try to withhold our votes for the server with the
 * lowest internet address (an easy-to-generate order).  To this effect, we
 * keep track (in #lowestTime and #lowestHost) of the lowest server trying to
 * become a sync site.  We wait for this server unless there is already a sync
 * site (indicated by ServBeacon's parameter being 1).
