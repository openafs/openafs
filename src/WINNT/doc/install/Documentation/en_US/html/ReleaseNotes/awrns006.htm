<HR><H1><A NAME="HDRSERVER" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_46">AFS Server Release Notes</A></H1>
<HR><H2><A NAME="Header_47" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_47">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>This section contains important information about the AFS Server
component of AFS for Windows, version 3.6. The AFS Server runs
AFS server processes on a Windows NT machine. An AFS Server on a
Windows NT machine can be configured as one or more of the following&#58; an
AFS File Server, an AFS Database Server, an AFS Backup Server, and an AFS
System Control Server.
<HR><H2><A NAME="Header_48" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_48">AFS Server Installation Requirements</A></H2>
<P>Your system must meet the following hardware, software, and
administrative privilege requirements to install the AFS Server component of
AFS for Windows.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_49" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_49">Hardware</A></H3>
<P>The hardware requirements for installing the AFS Server are&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>A PC using an 80486/66 MHz (or faster) microprocessor or Pentium-based
microprocessor 
<P><I>Recommended&#58; A PC using a Pentium or higher microprocessor</I>
<P><LI>At least 16 MB of RAM 
<P><I>Recommended&#58; 32 MB of RAM or more</I>
<P><LI>A hard disk with at least 20 MB of available disk space
<P><LI>At least one NTFS disk volume to hold the AFS file system data. The
NTFS volume must not contain any data or files other than that of a Windows NT
Recycle Bin to be eligible for configuration as an AFS partition.
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_50" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_50">Software</A></H3>
<P>The software requirements for installing the AFS Server are&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or Service Pack 5
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_51" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_51">Administrative Privilege Requirement</A></H3>
<P>You must be a member of the local <B>Administrators</B> group on
your Windows system in order to install, configure, and start the AFS
Server.
<HR><H2><A NAME="Header_52" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_52">Product Notes</A></H2>
<P>This section highlights important general information about the AFS
Server component of AFS for Windows, version 3.6. Included in
this section are descriptions of new features and enhancements made available
in this release of the AFS Server.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_53" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_53">Support for Volumes That Are Greater Than 2 GB</A></H3>
<P>An AFS volume is a collection of related files that are organized into
a single, easily managed unit and that can be easily moved between File Server
machines to facilitate load balancing across the network. Each AFS
volume has a specific quota associated with it. A volume&#39;s quota
specifies the maximum amount of disk space the information in the volume can
occupy. Quota is set on a per volume basis, so it can be increased for
volumes that contain more data and decreased for volumes that do not need the
additional space. AFS for Windows, version 3.6 now supports
volumes with quotas greater than 2 GB.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_54" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_54">Encryption Routines Used by the System Control Server Are Included with All Versions of AFS for Windows</A></H3>
<P>Encryption routines used by the Update Service on the System Control
Server machine are now being included with <I>all</I> versions of AFS for
Windows due to the relaxation of United States government export
regulations. Previously, government regulations prohibited the export
of these encryption routines. Thus, sites that were not running the
United States distribution of AFS were not able to use a System Control Server
to distribute configuration files, because doing so permitted sensitive system
information to be transmitted unencrypted. Now, all sites can use a
System Control Server machine to distribute new versions of AFS Server
configuration information to all AFS File Server machines.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_55" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_55">AFS Server Computer Name Must Correspond to the Name Service Host Name</A></H3>
<P>The computer name of an AFS Server machine (as displayed in the
<B>Computer Name</B> field on the <B>Identification</B> tab of the
Network dialog box) must correspond to the host name assigned to the computer
by the name service (normally the Domain Name Service, or DNS) used to map
names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. For example, if the machine
on which the AFS Server is installed has the computer name
<B>afsserver1</B> and is in the <B>yourcompany.com</B> domain,
the corresponding DNS entry for the machine must be
<B>afsserver1.yourcompany.com</B>.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_56" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_56">Time Clock Synchronization</A></H3>
<P>To support security and database replication protocols, the time clocks
on all machines running AFS servers must be synchronized. Time
synchronization software can be obtained from numerous sources; for
example, Microsoft distributes the <B>timeserv</B> time synchronization
service with the Windows NT Server Resource Kit.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_57" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_57">Securing AFS Server Machines</A></H3>
<P>If the machine on which the AFS Server software is installed is not
secure (that is, if nonadministrative personnel are able to log into the
machine), then it is strongly recommended that the AFS Server software
directories and all AFS partitions on the machine be secured as appropriate
for the environment and file system type. However, when securing AFS
Server machines, ensure that the Windows NT local <B>SYSTEM</B> principal
has full access to the AFS software and all AFS partitions; otherwise AFS
processes will not be able to run.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_58" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_58">Shutting Down AFS File Server Machines</A></H3>
<P>Before shutting down a Windows NT machine that is running as an AFS
File Server, always stop the AFS File Server on the machine.
<P>When the AFS File Server is started on a machine, the process creates a
salvage file. When the File Server is stopped manually, this salvage
file is removed. However, if a Windows NT machine is shut down while
the AFS File Server is still running, this salvage file is not removed.
When the machine is subsequently restarted, the File Server starts
automatically and, upon noticing the presence of the salvage file, executes
the Salvager. Because running the Salvager can be very time consuming,
it is always preferable to stop the AFS File Server on a machine before
shutting the machine down to avoid unnecessarily executing the Salvager
process.
<P>Use one of the following procedures to shut down the AFS File Server on a
Windows NT machine.
<P>
<UL>
<P><LI>From the Windows NT Control Panel&#58;
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Double-click the <B>Services</B> icon. The Services dialog box
opens.
<P><LI>In the <B>Service</B> list, select the <B>IBM AFS Server</B>
service.
<P><LI>Choose the <B>Stop</B> button. A message box appears, prompting
you to confirm that you want to stop the service. Choose the
<B>Yes</B> button.
<P>The AFS File Server on the machine is stopped.
</OL>
<P><LI>From the Windows NT Command Prompt&#58;
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>Enter the following command&#58;
<PRE>bos shutdown -server <VAR>machine_name</VAR> -wait
</PRE>
<P>where <I>machine_name</I> is the name of the Windows NT machine on
which the AFS File Server is running.
<P><LI>Press &lt;<B>Enter</B>> to execute the command.
</OL>
</UL>
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">In general, machines that are running as AFS File Servers are shut down only
to perform preventative maintenance.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_59" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_59">Obtaining Crash Dump Files in the Event of Server Problems</A></H3>
<P>It is recommended that you configure all AFS Server machines to create
a crash dump file in the event of a server failure. This information is
important for technical support personnel to use in order to diagnose a server
problem. Consult your Microsoft Windows NT documentation for
information on how to configure the Dr. Watson utility to generate a
binary crash dump file automatically when an application error occurs.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_60" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_60">The AFS Server Must Be Installed in a Directory Whose Path Contains Only ANSI Characters</A></H3>
<P>The AFS for Windows software can only be installed in a directory whose
path contains only ANSI characters, for example the default directory
<B>C&#58;\Program Files</B>.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_61" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_61">Temporary Files</A></H3>
<P>The AFS Server for Windows occasionally creates temporary files.
To control where such files are created, set your environment variable (TMP or
TEMP) to the fully qualified path of the preferred temporary directory.
If you do not specify a temporary directory, then any temporary files are
created in the current working directory of the process that creates the
files.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_62" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_62">National Language Support for the AFS Server</A></H3>
<P>AFS provides national language support for the AFS Server graphical
user interface (GUI) tools and documentation, including support for
bidirectional scripts (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.). The language
strings installed are determined by your machine&#39;s system default locale,
as specified in the Control Panel&#39;s Regional Settings Properties dialog
box. If no language strings exist for the current locale, then English
language strings are installed by default.
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">The <I>system default</I> locale for a machine can be different than the
<I>user</I> locale (specified by a user) on the machine. However,
the language strings installed with AFS for Windows are always determined by
the system default locale.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_63" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_63">The kpwvalid Password Strength Checker Is Not Used on Windows Systems</A></H3>
<P>When an AFS user password is changed from a Windows system, the
<B>kpwvalid</B> program is <I>not</I> used to check the quality of the
new password. (On UNIX systems, if a <B>kpwvalid</B> program exists
in the same directory as the <B>kpasswd</B> program, the
<B>kpwvalid</B> program checks the quality of every new user
password.)
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_64" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_64">Configuring a Server into a Cell with pre-3.5 Database Servers Requires the Principal Password</A></H3>
<P>If you configure the AFS Server for Windows, version 3.6, into
an AFS cell in which the Database Servers are running a version of AFS older
than version 3.5, during the configuration process a dialog box prompts
you to provide the AFS principal password.
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">If for some reason the AFS principal password is unknown, you can instead
enter the 24-character string of octal digits representing the AFS
principal&#39;s key. To obtain the octal key, issue either the
<B>kas examine</B> command or <B>boslistkeys</B> command on an AFS
Database Server machine. Note, the server must be running in
<B>noauth</B> mode in order to display the AFS principal&#39;s octal
key.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<HR><H2><A NAME="Header_65" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_65">Limitations and Restrictions</A></H2>
<P>This section briefly describes the known limitations and restrictions
in the AFS Server component of AFS for Windows, version 3.6.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_66" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_66">AFS bosserver Process Does Not Execute the Notifier Program When a Process Terminates</A></H3>
<P>The AFS <B>bosserver</B> process does not currently execute the
registered notifier command (if one is specified) when a process under its
control terminates.
