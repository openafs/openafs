<HR><H1><A NAME="HDRCLIENT" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_6">AFS Client Release Notes</A></H1>
<HR><H2><A NAME="Header_7" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_7">Introduction</A></H2>
<P>This section contains important information about the AFS Client
component of AFS for Windows, version 3.6. The AFS Client
provides direct access to the AFS filespace from a PC running Windows NT,
enabling users to manage files and directories in AFS. The AFS Client
includes the AFS Light Gateway, which enables AFS Light users to access the
AFS filespace.
<HR><H2><A NAME="HDRPREREQ" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_8">AFS Client Installation Requirements</A></H2>
<P>Your system must meet the following hardware, software, and
administrative privilege requirements to install the AFS Client.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_9" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_9">Hardware</A></H3>

microprocessor
<P><LI>At least 16 MB of RAM
<P><LI>A hard disk with at least 4 MB of available disk space, plus enough
additional disk space on the drive where the cache is located to accommodate
the desired cache size. (By default, the cache is located on the drive
where Windows is installed and the cache size is 20 MB.)
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_10" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_10">Software</A></H3>
<P>The software requirements for installing the AFS Client are&#58;
<UL>
<P><LI>Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 4 or Service Pack 5
</UL>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_11" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_11">Administrative Privilege Requirement</A></H3>
<P>You must be a member of the local <B>Administrators</B> group on
your Windows system in order to install, configure, and start the AFS
Client.
<HR><H2><A NAME="Header_12" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_12">Product Notes</A></H2>
<P>This section highlights important general information about the AFS
Client component of AFS for Windows, version 3.6. It includes
descriptions of new features and enhancements made available in this release
of the AFS Client.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_13" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_13">Additional Configuration Options Available Via the Client Interface</A></H3>
<P>The AFS Client Configuration utility&#39;s <B>Advanced</B> tab now
includes options for configuring logon parameters, diagnostic parameters, and
other miscellaneous configuration parameters. From the
<B>Advanced</B> tab, you can also configure global drive mappings.
Many of these configuration options were formerly available to AFS Client
users as registry settings.
<P>The <B>Advanced</B> tab is accessed from the Windows Control
Panel. To display the <B>Advanced</B> tab&#58;
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>From the <B>Start</B> menu, choose <B>Settings</B>, then choose
<B>Control Panel</B>.
<P><LI>Double-click the <B>AFS Client Configuration</B> icon to display the
AFS Client Configuration utility.
<P><LI>Choose the <B>Advanced</B> tab.
</OL>
<P><H3><A NAME="HDRCACHE" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_14">AFS Client Cache Location Is Now Configurable</A></H3>
<P>The AFS Client Cache is stored in a file named <B>AFSCache</B>,
rather than in the system paging file. By default, the cache is stored
on the drive where Windows is installed. The size of the AFS Client
Cache is limited by available free disk space. The cache size must be
at least 1 MB. The default cache size is 20480 KB (20MB).
<P>The location of the AFS Client Cache can now be changed. Changing
the cache location is useful when there is not sufficient available free disk
space on the drive where Windows is installed. To change the cache
location, enter a valid, fully qualified filename in the <B>Cache Path</B>
field on the AFS Client Configuration&#39;s <B>Advanced</B> tab.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_15" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_15">Mapping Global Drives to the AFS Filespace</A></H3>
<P>The AFS Client&#39;s graphical user interface can now be used to map
global drives to places in the AFS filespace. Global drives are mapped
to the AFS filespace when the IBM AFS Client service starts; users are
not required to be logged on. To map global drives to AFS&#58;
<OL TYPE=1>
<P><LI>From the <B>Start</B> menu, choose <B>Settings</B>, then choose
<B>Control Panel</B>.
<P><LI>Double-click the <B>AFS Client Configuration</B> icon to display the
AFS Client Configuration utility. Select the <B>Advanced</B>
tab.
<P><LI>Click <B>Add</B>. The Map Global Drive dialog box
appears. In the <B>Drive Letter</B> box, choose a network drive or
accept the default. In the <B>AFS Path</B> box, type a path to the
AFS filespace. If desired, enter a short name to be associated with the
specified drive letter and AFS path in the <B>Description</B> box.
Note that a drive letter description can have no more than 12 characters and
cannot contain spaces or tabs.
<P><LI>Click <B>OK</B> to establish the connection. The drive letter
and AFS path appear on the Global Drives dialog box. The drive letter
now appears in your Windows NT Explorer.
</OL>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_16" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_16">AFS Client Computer Name Must Correspond to the Name Service Host Name</A></H3>
<P>The computer name of an AFS Client machine (as displayed in the
<B>Computer Name</B> field on the <B>Identification</B> tab of the
Network dialog box) must correspond to the host name assigned to the computer
by the name service (normally the Domain Name Service, or DNS) used to map
names to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. For example, if the machine
on which the AFS Client is installed has the computer name
<B>afsclient1</B> and is in the <B>yourcompany.com</B> domain,
the corresponding DNS entry for the machine must be
<B>afsclient1.yourcompany.com</B>.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_17" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_17">AFS Command-Line Binaries</A></H3>
<P>The AFS Client includes administration-oriented command suites such as
<B>bos</B>, <B>kas</B>, <B>vos</B>, and <B>pts</B>.
Execute the commands within these suites from the Windows Command
Prompt.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_18" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_18">The AFS Client Must Be Installed in a Directory Whose Path Contains Only ANSI Characters</A></H3>
<P>The AFS for Windows software must be installed in a directory whose
path contains only ANSI characters, for example the default directory
<B>C&#58;\Program Files</B>.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_19" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_19">Disabling All but the Client Component of the AFS for Windows Setup Program</A></H3>
<P>You have the option of altering the AFS for Windows setup program to
disable all but the client component. Such a client-only setup program
renders users unable to install any components other than the AFS
Client. To perform a client-only installation, create the file
<B>setup.co</B> in the same directory as the other installation
files; the setup program then allows only the AFS Client to be
installed. Note that the contents of the <B>setup.co</B>
file are irrelevant. Follow the installation procedure described in
<I>IBM AFS for Windows Quick Beginnings</I> regardless of the type of
installation you are performing.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_20" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_20">Temporary Files</A></H3>
<P>The AFS Client for Windows occasionally creates temporary files.
To control where such files are created, set your environment variable (TMP or
TEMP) to the fully qualified path of the preferred temporary directory.
If you do not specify a temporary directory, then any temporary files are
created in the current working directory of the process that creates the
files.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_21" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_21">National Language Support for the AFS Client</A></H3>
<P>AFS provides national language support for the AFS Client graphical
user interface (GUI) tools and documentation, including support for
bidirectional scripts (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.). The language
strings installed are determined by your machine&#39;s system default locale,
as specified in the Control Panel&#39;s Regional Settings Properties dialog
box. If no language strings exist for the current locale, then English
language strings are installed by default.
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP"><B>Note:</B></TD><TD ALIGN="LEFT" VALIGN="TOP">The <I>system default</I> locale for a machine can be different than the
<I>user</I> locale (specified by a user) on the machine. However,
the language strings installed with AFS for Windows are always determined by
the system default locale.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_22" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_22">The kpwvalid Password Strength Checker Is Not Used on Windows Systems</A></H3>
<P>When an AFS user password is changed from a Windows system, the
<B>kpwvalid</B> program is <I>not</I> used to check the quality of the
new password. (On UNIX systems, if a <B>kpwvalid</B> program exists
in the same directory as the <B>kpasswd</B> program, the
<B>kpwvalid</B> program checks the quality of every new user
password.)
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_23" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_23">Configurable LAN Adapter Number</A></H3>
<P>The LAN Adapter (LANA) number used by the AFS Client service must match
the LANA number setting on your Windows system. By default, the AFS
Client service is configured to use LANA number <B>0</B> (zero).
<P>You can now use the AFS Client&#39;s graphical user interface tools to
modify the value of the LANA number used by the AFS Client service. To
change the LANA number, enter a new value in the <B>Lan Adapter Number</B>
field on the AFS Client Configuration&#39;s <B>Advanced</B> tab.
You must restart the AFS Client service after modifying this parameter.
<P>Alternatively, if you do not want to change the default LANA number used by
the AFS Client service to match the NetBIOS Configuration of your Windows NT
machine, you can instead modify your system&#39;s LANA number setting to
match the AFS default setting (<B>0</B>). Access the
<B>Services</B> tab on the Control Panel&#39;s Network
application. Choose <B>NetBIOS Interface</B>, and select the
<B>Properties</B> button. Enter <B>0</B> (zero) in the
<B>Lana Number</B> field. You must restart your machine after
making changes to this Windows setting.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_24" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_24">WinLogon Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA) Modules and AFS Authentication</A></H3>
<P>The AFS Client includes the header files and libraries required to
build a WinLogon Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA) module
that obtains AFS tokens. These header files and libraries are installed
in the <B> &lt;</B><I>AFS for Windows Installation
Directory</I><B>>\afs\client\program</B> directory. In addition,
a sample program with compiling and linking instructions is provided in
<B>&lt;</B><I>AFS for Windows Installation
Directory</I><B>>\afs\client\program\sample\token.c</B>.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_25" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_25">Cell Database Is Maintained During Upgrade</A></H3>
<P>When the AFS Client software is upgraded, the AFS Client cell database
file (<B>afsdcell.ini</B>) located in the <B>Windows</B>
directory is not replaced, in order to preserve local cell configuration
information. However, a copy of the cell database as distributed by the
vendor is installed in the AFS Client program directory.
<P>
<HR><H2><A NAME="Header_26" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_26">Limitations and Restrictions</A></H2>
<P>This section briefly describes the known limitations and restrictions
in the AFS Client component of AFS for Windows, version 3.6.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_27" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_27">Symbolic Links to AFS Files and Directories</A></H3>
<P>Symbolic links to directories are treated as directories, and symbolic
links to files appear as files in Windows NT systems. Neither appear as
links.
<P>Currently, you cannot use the Windows interface (the Windows NT Explorer,
for example) to delete symbolic links or create symbolic links in the AFS
filespace. If you attempt to delete a directory that is a symbolic link
using the Windows interface, the directory&#39;s contents are deleted.
The directory itself is not deleted. If you attempt to delete a file
that is a symbolic link using the Windows interface, the link is removed,
rather than the target file.
<P>To create and delete symbolic links to AFS files and directories, use the
<B>symlink.exe</B> program that is provided with AFS for Windows,
version 3.6. Execute <B>symlink</B> commands from your
Windows NT Command Prompt.
<P><H3><A NAME="Header_28" HREF="awrns002.htm#ToC_28">AFS Client Can Fail to Load When Network Drives Are in the Application Path</A></H3>
<P>When loading an application (such as the AFS Client), Windows NT
searches for the application&#39;s dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). One
of the places that Windows searches for an application&#39;s DLLs is in each
directory specified in the Path environment variable. In the Path
environment variable, if a network path is defined before the path that
contains a DLL, the application can possible fail to load.
<P>Most services (such as the AFS Client) do not have security access to
network drives specified in the Path environment variable. When a
network drive is encountered in the path and the application does not have the
permission to access the network, Windows fails to distinguish between an
Access Denied error caused by a process which cannot access a file and a
process which cannot access the network drive that contains the file.
Because this distinction cannot be made, the operating system assumes that the
file exists but cannot be accessed by the process. This error causes
the system to discontinue the search for the DLLs and assume that a DLL cannot
be accessed. Since Windows believes that a DLL is inaccessible, it
fails to load the application.
<P>In order to avoid this problem, ensure that the directory to an
application&#39;s DLLs comes before any network drives in the path.
