# Configuration information for AFS client.

# Set to "-verbose" for a lot of debugging information from afsd.  Only useful
# for debugging as it prints a LOT of information.
VERBOSE=

# AFS client configuration options.
#
# Here is a (mostly) complete list of flags that afsd accepts and that are
# useful here:
#
#   -blocks     The number of blocks available in the workstation cache.
#   -files      The target number of files in the workstation cache (Default:
#               1000).
#   -rootvol    The name of the root volume to use.
#   -stat       The number of stat cache entries.
#   -hosts      List of servers to check for volume location info FOR THE
#               HOME CELL.
#   -memcache   Use an in-memory cache rather than disk.
#   -cachedir   The base directory for the workstation cache.
#   -mountdir   The directory on which the AFS is to be mounted.
#   -confdir    The configuration directory.
#   -nosettime  Don't keep checking the time to avoid drift (default).
#   -settime    Keep checking the time to avoid drift.
#   -verbose    Be chatty.
#   -debug      Print out additional debugging info.
#   -daemons    The number of background daemons to start (Default: 2).
#   -rmtsys     Also fires up an afs remote sys call (e.g. pioctl, setpag)
#               support daemon 
#   -chunksize  2^n is the chunksize to be used (Default: use a kernel
#               module default).
#   -dcache     The number of data cache entries.
#   -prealloc   Number of preallocated "small" memory blocks
#   -waitclose  Make close calls always synchronous (slows them down, though)
#   -files_per_subdir   Number of files per cache subdir (Default: 2048).
#
# Using the memory cache is not recommended.  It's less stable than the disk
# cache and doesn't improve performance as much as it might sound.
#
# The default behavior is to let afsd automatically choose an apporpriate set
# of flags.  This should produce reasonable behavior for most working sets
# provided that one is using a modern AFS client (1.4.2 or later).
#
# You can override that default behavior by setting OPTIONS to a specific set
# of flags.
OPTIONS="-afsdb -stat 2000 -dcache 800 -daemons 3 -volumes 70 -dynroot -fakestat-all"

# The default value for the client sysname (as returned by fs sysname) is
# determined during the kernel module build and is taken from the architecture
# and the major Linux kernel version.  Accesses to directories named "@sys" in
# AFS will be internally redirected to a directory by this name by the AFS
# client, allowing a single path to resolve to different directories depending
# on the client architecture.
#
# If you would like to override the client sysname, uncomment this line and
# set the variable to a space-separated list of sysnames.  The AFS client will
# attempt to resolve @sys to each directory name in the order given.
AFS_SYSNAME=""

# If you want to prefer particular servers for replicated volumes, you can
# configure that by defining an afs_server_prefs function here and then
# uncommenting the setting of AFS_POST_INIT below.  For more information, see
# fs help setserverprefs and fs getserverprefs (for the current values).

#afs_server_prefs() {
#    fs setserverprefs <host> <rank>
#}

# If you want to always run some command after starting OpenAFS, you can put
# it here.  Note that you cannot run multiple commands, even combined with &&
# or ; or similar shell meta-characters.  If you want to run multiple
# commands, define a shell function instead and put the name of the shell
# function here.
AFS_POST_INIT=

# Uncomment this line if you defined an afs_server_prefs function.  (If you
# have other commands that you also want to run, you'll have to put them in
# that function, as you can only run one function.)
#AFS_POST_INIT=afs_server_prefs

# If you want to always run some command before shutting down OpenAFS, you can
# put it here.  The same caveat applies about multiple commands.
AFS_PRE_SHUTDOWN=
