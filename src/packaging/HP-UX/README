This directory contains a Product Specification File (PSF) which defines
the layout of OpenAFS using the transarc-paths (--enable-transarc-paths).  If
you did not run configure --enable-transarc-paths, using the psf file to
package the distribution will work, but you will be missing directories
when running the servers.  

The source files and controlled scripts contained in these products'
filesets are also provided in this directory.  

In order to package the sofware using HP's Software Distributor follow 
the following procedure:

Ensure the AFS docs are installed in the AFS build directory.

Install the latest SD patch PHCO_27672, earlier patches will work, but 
this patch fixes several memory leaks.

Change directory to the top level directory, replacing the "x" with the
correct version number:

	cd <path-to-toplevel>/openafs-1.2.x

Run the configure --enable-transarc-paths

Then create the distribution directory:

	make dest

Once the build in the distribution directory is completed, change dir to
the swpackage directory:

	cd <path-to-toplevel>/openafs-1.2.x/src/packaging/HP-UX

Test the package creation, replace the "x" with the version just compiled:

	swpackage -p -s psf-1.2.x-transarc-paths-11.00 

The package does include vfsck, mount, umount, etc. for installation in 
/sbin/fs/afs.  You will have to move the files into 
hp_ux110/dest/root.server/etc in order to package them. 

Run:
	swpackage -s psf-1.2.x-transarc-paths-11.xx [@ /dir/to/destination_depot]

This command will package the product for installation with software distributor
into /var/spool/sw unless an alternate depot [ @ /dir/to/destination_depot] 
is defined.

Files can be compressed before transfer to the depot by using

  swpackage -x compress_files=true -x reinstall_files=true \
	-s psf-1.2.x-transarc-paths-11.xx [@ /dir/to/destination_depot]

The psf file is designed to package the software for installation on 
32bit or 64bit HP-UX 11.00.  The binaries should be compiled with +DAportable or
+DA1.0, or other options that allow binary compatibility between operating 
the two operating systems (32bit or 64 bit).

When installed, the package does install the kernel library, master.d file, 
regen the kernel and cause a reboot.

The 1.2.10 package does upgrade the 1.2.9 or the 1.2.8 package, so if a 
previous version is packaged and installed a later packaged product will
upgrade it.  (Worked for me).

Follow the Quick Start Guide after installation to configure OPENAFS

Feel free to make any corrections to any mistakes I may have made.
